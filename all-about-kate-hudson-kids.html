Her Instagram is full of photos with her family, whether they're taking an epic vacation or just hanging out at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress welcomed her first child, Ryder, with her ex-husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chris Robinson</a> in 2004, followed by her second son, Bingham, whom she shares with her former fiancé <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Matt Bellamy</a>, in 2011. Hudson's family grew once again in 2018, when she gave birth to her first daughter, Rani, with her fiancé <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Danny Fujikawa</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hudson previously joked about the fact that each of her kids has a different father during an appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sunday Today with Willie Geist</a>. "I've got multiple dads, I've got kids all over the place," she said with a laugh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She spoke further about her relationship with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her kids' three fathers</a> in a November 2022 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>The Sunday Times</a>. "It might not look traditional from the outside, but on the inside I feel like we're killing it," she said of co-parenting with the three men. "The unit that I've created with three children with three different fathers is a seriously strong unit, and it's ours."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Almost Famous star also talked about the difficulty of managing her blended family during the COVID-19 pandemic. "I wanna be like, 'Yeah, it's so great and we're figuring it out,' " she said. "But the reality is that there are days that are great, and there's days that I have to remind myself to be grateful."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, Hudson is a pro at managing her family dynamics. In April 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she shared photos</a> of herself, Fujikawa and their daughter Rani alongside her ex-fiancé Bellamy, their son Bingham, Bellamy's wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Elle Evans</a> and their daughter Lovella. The families celebrated the Easter holiday together.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kate Hudson Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for expanding her family even more, Hudson isn't ruling anything out. During a 2020 appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>, the actress said she was open to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>having more children</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't know if I'm done," she said. "I'm in that place of like, right now, Rani is at that age where you're like, 'I want another baby.' But once she gets like 4 or 5, you're like, 'I feel like my life is kinda back a little bit [and] they're kinda in a groove.' It's weird … it's like a window."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hudson spoke again about the possibility of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>having more kids</a> during an interview for Byrdie's "After-Dark" digital issue, which was published on Dec. 12, 2022. "I've been having children my entire adult life," she explained. "I've got my 4-year-old and I've got a kid in college. And I don't even know if I'm done yet. You know, I don't have that answer yet."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For now, though, Hudson is clearly enjoying life with her three kids. Here's everything to know about Kate Hudson's children: Ryder, Bingham and Rani.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ryder-russell-robinson-20></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Ryder Russell Robinson</strong>, 20</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ryder Robinson Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born on Jan. 7, 2004, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ryder Russell Robinson</a> is the son of Hudson and her ex-husband Chris Robinson of The Black Crowes. The couple finalized their divorce in 2007.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His middle name has a special meaning: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>it's a tribute</a> to Hudson's stepfather, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kurt Russell</a>, who has been her mom <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Goldie Hawn</a>'s partner since 1983.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ryder looks like he may follow in his parents' famous footsteps: Hudson's older son is a musician and plays guitar in his band <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Codependence</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hudson has also said that she thinks her family's acting genes were passed down to her son as well. During an appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Late Night with Seth Meyers</a>, Hudson shared that Ryder is "deeply funny."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ryder — I mean, he's clearly gonna probably <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>follow in the footsteps</a> of the family. And I would say he's probably the funniest in our family. So, this is like every day for me. Nobody makes me laugh like Ryder, and he just constantly makes fun of me," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ryder is also one half of a young Hollywood "it" couple: he's been dating <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Iris Apatow</a> (daughter of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Judd Apatow</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Leslie Mann</a> and sister of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Maude Apatow</a>) since at least February 2022. A source told PEOPLE that the two <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>had been close for a long time</a> after growing up together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Drew Barrymore Show</a>, Iris called Ryder "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>a lovely angel</a>" in her life. "It's going very well," she said. "We have been together for a while … It's very refreshing when you grow up — in high school and just dating around, I had my fair share of weirdos."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kate Hudson Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ryder marked a huge milestone in June 2022 with his high school graduation. Hudson <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shared photos from Ryder's graduation</a> on Instagram, which she attended alongside ex-husband Robinson. "Today was a big day for our family," she captioned a snap of her and Ryder posing with Bingham and Rani.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"@mr.ryderrobinson you are the most incredible young man," she went on. "Raising you has been one of the great gifts and pleasures of my life. You bring so much to everyone's life. You are kind, loving, generous, patient, hilarious and one of a kind. I am so excited for this new chapter."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, Hudson accompanied Ryder while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he got a tattoo</a> featuring his younger siblings' initials: CBR. C is for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Cheyenne Genevieve</a> (Ryder's sister and Robinson's daughter with ex-wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Allison Bridges</a>), B is for Bingham and R is for Rani.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2022, the actress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>posted a video</a> arm wrestling her son at the kitchen island. In the clip, Ryder manages to push down his mom's arm before Hudson laughs and turns to check on cooking bacon. "He's back…. 💪 🥓," she wrote in the Instagram caption.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hudson posted about her son again in January 2024, when she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>marked his 20th birthday</a>. The actress shared a photo of Ryder's cake which included a baby picture of him holding a camera on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram</a>. In the caption, she wrote, "I’m gonna have to let this one digest for a bit..: 😭 My beautiful boy, happy 20th.

Hudson and Bellamy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>broke up in 2014</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bingham's name <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>contains a special meaning</a>. After Bingham was born, Bellamy said that Bingham was his mother's maiden name, and Bing Russell was Kurt Russell's dad. "Family connections all round!" Bellamy tweeted. Bingham's middle name, Hawn, is an obvious nod to Hudson's mother, Goldie Hawn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an appearance on Seth Meyers, Hudson shared that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bing loved the stock market</a>, saying he even wanted stocks for his upcoming 11th birthday. "I don't know how it happened," she said. "He follows them. He wakes up, he looks on his apps and follows his stocks, and he makes good money. He loves his stocks!" She added that Foot Locker was one of his favorites.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kate Hudson Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bing also plays on a baseball team.

In an interview with Women's Health, the actress talked about how <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>co-parenting brought her closer</a> to Bellamy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One thing that Matt said to me, which I loved, is 'I just want to make sure that Bing feels like he's gaining something, not losing something,' " she said.

Hudson explained that Rani (pronounced like Ronnie) was named after Danny's father, Ron Fujikawa, who passed away in 2012. "To name her after him is an honor," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a toddler, Rani developed an early passion for cooking. In 2022, Hudson told PEOPLE that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rani is always by her side in the kitchen</a>. "Rani loves food and I cook with her all the time," she said. "She's my little helper.

"She's really special," she said. "She's just this loving, funny — she's hilarious, oh my God — and she likes to be funny. You know, she's goofy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rani is also already a budding fashionista and makeup lover. In April 2022, Hudson showed off the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rainbow-inspired makeup look</a> her daughter requested. The proud mom also previously showed off Rani's fashion sense, posting a carousel of photos of her modeling different outfits with the caption, "I know NYFW is currently happening east coast BUT it's a daily thing over here guys."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Rani's 4th birthday in October 2022, grandparents Hawn and Russell got into the spirit by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dressing up in prince and princess costumes</a> with the birthday girl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Happy 4th birthday our precious Rani Rose🌹You are the real queen!"

WE LOVE YOU!!! 💕💕💕💕🎂🎂🎂🎂."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, Hudson treated her daughter to a home spa day, complete with an avocado face mask, cucumbers for Rani's eyes and even a foot massage. The doting mom posted a video of the pampering <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>on Instagram</a>, captioning the post with, "It might be time to hide the avocados… 🥑."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it seems Rani likes being doted on, the 5-year-old has also proved to be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a good helper</a> to her mom. When Hudson fixed up her future mother-in-law's backyard on a Dec. 5, 2022, episode of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>HGTV</a>'s Celebrity IOU, Rani was there to contribute some elbow grease.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the episode, the girl was seen helping in the garden, shovel in hand.
