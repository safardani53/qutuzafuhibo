He <a href=#>pretended he didn’t know the comedian</a> when TMZ photographers asked about her, seemingly quoting an infamous <strong><a href=#>Mariah Carey</a></strong> line. “Who?” he asked. “I don’t know her.”</p><p>Griffin was outraged at the time. “Even when it’s on tape, there are doubters? He is NOT kidding w paps,” she tweeted in October 2017. “Was my boss for 10 years. Treated me like a dog. Deeply misogynistic.”</p><p>Cohen and the actress worked together on Bravo for years. Her reality show, Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List, aired six seasons from 2005 to 2010, and she also had several stand-up specials air on Bravo.</p><p>However, Griffin found herself outcast from much of Hollywood after she posed for a photo with a prop that looked like President <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>‘s bloody, severed head in spring 2017. Her nine-year gig as<a href=#> <strong>Anderson Cooper</strong></a>‘s cohost ended when <a href=#>CNN fired her</a> in response to the graphic photo.</p><p>Cooper also denounced the picture at the time, writing in a statement via Twitter that it was “clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.” A few months later, he claimed to Cohen that he and the Illinois native were “still friends.”</p><p>In late 2017, a source told Us Weekly exclusively that Griffin was still <a href=#>devastated by Cooper’s reaction</a> to the incident.</p><p>“[She is] still really <a href=#>heartbroken over the friendship lost</a> with [him],” the insider explained at the time. “[Her] friendship [with Cooper] ended almost immediately after he tweeted about her photo.”</p><p>The source added: “She most definitely feels like Anderson has sided with Andy. She hates Andy Cohen.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Five years later, Griffin made it clear that she still didn’t have any warm, fuzzy feelings for the Missouri native, <a href=#>calling him a “misogynist”</a> via Instagram in December 2022 and adding that she planned to watch Miley’s New Year’s Eve Party, hosted by <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Dolly Parton</strong></a>, to ring in 2023.</p><p>Scroll down for everything to know about Cohen and Griffin’s feud:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrq%2Bw2GaaqKCVo3qiusNmopqsmK56qL7In52ipqNis6bBw2aroaqfqrSpedOhnGaxlZa%2FtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
