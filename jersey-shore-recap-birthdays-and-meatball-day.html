Come along as we recap Jersey Shore, THG style!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Deena breaks down when she hears about Vinny. “He was like, my soul,” she says. Really? Your soul? Do you even know what that is? We love Vin but <strong>Minus 7</strong>.</p><p>“I’m going to smash this tattoo chick in my man Vinny’s bed tonight, in honor of him leaving the house.” – Pauly D with one of the best <a href=#>Jersey Shore quotes</a> to date. <strong>Plus 30</strong>.</p><p>“It is what it is, I’m used to it,” says a mature Jenni, who HAS to be the one that implodes at some point, right? She’s been way too stable of late. Still, <strong>Plus 15</strong>.</p><p>The Situation speaks Italian with Pauly D’s girl. Impressive? Sleazy? Eh, <strong>Wash</strong>.</p><p>Vinny returns home to his family. His mom greets him not with joy and warmth, but by telling him to go to bed. Wasn’t expecting the cameras, probably.<strong> Plus 5</strong>.</p><p>Isn’t that why he came back, too? To be told what to do by his mom? <strong>Minus 5</strong>.</p><p>“Meatball Day” ends badly for Deena and Snooki. <strong>Plus 20</strong>, because with those two, it can’t possibly end “well” in the conventional sense. They go hard. Respect.</p><p>Deena rips out her hair extensions. You mean she’s not all-natural?! <strong>Minus 10</strong>.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span>JWoww naps through her shift at work. Showing 80 percent of her breasts to whomever might walk by. What’s the point of even wearing clothes? Still, <strong>Plus 11</strong>.<p>The Situation checks out a new Shore Store customer.<strong> Plus 10</strong> because at least it’s not some grenade or land mine. But <strong>Minus 15</strong> for lack of stealthiness.</p><p>Back to Meatball Day for a moment. If that means daytime boozing sans pants and “underwears” popping out, they could rename it Wednesday. <strong>Minus 18</strong>.</p><p>The roommates call to check on Vinny. Aww.<strong> Plus 8</strong>.</p><p>Ron wore skinny jeans in honor of Vinny. Ron! <strong>Plus 3</strong>.</p><p>The Situation continues to hook up with Paula, and proves that against all odds, he may be capable of sustaining a real relationship? Or something? <strong>Plus 9</strong>.</p><p>When Pauly D’s girl says she just wants to talk, he calls her a cab. Yep, time to get ‘er outta here. All that’s missing is the grenade horn sounding.<strong> Plus 12</strong>.</p><p>That tool <a href=#>The Unit</a> is in town! Fist-pump/head-slap! <strong>Wash</strong>.</p><p>Sitch wants to play “Gym, Tan, The Truth Will Set You Free.” <strong>Minus 9</strong> because not even fans care that much about it anymore, let alone his alleged pals.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong></strong></a>Alas, before Mike can even cause drama with Snooki, The Unit gets kicked out of the club for fighting. <strong>Plus 10</strong> because that was likely best for everyone.</p><p>Sammi bonds with Paula, who she actually seems to like, even though she is all grimy and such.<strong> Plus 7</strong> for girls showing a little mutual respect!</p><p>Mike admits he could get “wifed up” to Paula. Plus 10 for the sentiment, but<strong> Minus 15</strong> because that just means girlfriend in Situation/Guido-speak.</p><p>Paula’s so DTF she lets Mike scrawl “DTF” on her butt in marker. “She’s like AAA. You call her and she’s there!” Wife dat up, Sitch, Wife it. <strong>Plus 20</strong>.</p><p>Bosnian Grilled Cheese is becoming a Stage 3 or 4 stalker! <strong>Minus 12</strong>.</p><p>Pauly D gets a birthday haircut. Scary, but the blowout emerged A-OK. <strong>Plus 6</strong>.</p><p>Surrounded by his friends and family, Pauly D blows out his candles.<strong> Plus 7</strong> because who doesn’t love Pauly D. Apparently no one, and for good reason. Solid dude.</p><p>The guys prank Sitch after he isolates himself during Pauly D’s dinner. Writing DOUCHE on his face in permanent marker would’ve been better, but <strong>Plus 9</strong> for effort.</p><p>Sammi and the girls bake a cake for Pauly D’s birthday. <strong>Plus 8</strong>, as that is such a “family” thing to do. Mike has always referred to them as such, which is odd, since …</p><p>Situation feels alone during his own birthday. <strong>Minus 19</strong>, Mike, because there is only one person to blame for that. Stop causing drama and 2012 will be different!</p><p>Seriously, what do you expect when you stir $h!t up with Snooki and Jionni as a present to yourself. It’s like you want no friends. Mission accomplished! <strong>Minus 11</strong>.</p><p>“That’s what you get for being a f–king douchebag.” – Snooki. Yep. <strong>Plus 5</strong>.</p><p><strong>EPISODE TOTAL: +8! SEASON TOTAL: +104!</strong></p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pqX2V%2BcLbEq6qesV2otbC%2BxGapnpuRpXqjtdGtn52Zqah6orrDZqSemaSXrq24jJ2Ysmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
