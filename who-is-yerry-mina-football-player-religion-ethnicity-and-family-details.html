Football Player Religion, Ethnicity And Family Details</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Religion of Yerry Mina:</strong> Is the Columbian football player Muslim or Christian? Let’s look at his family and ethnicity. Yerry Mina is a professional footballer for Columbia’s national team and Premier League club Everton. Mina also plays center back for his squad.</p><p>The football player also holds the record for most goals scored by a defender in a single World Cup, with three at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. When he was 18 years old, Yerry began his football career with the team Deportivo Pas. On March 20, 2013, he made his senior debut.&nbsp;In 2016, Mina was picked to Colombia’s Copa America Centenario roster, which faced Costa Rica. He also appeared in five of Colombia’s 2018 World Cup qualifiers between 2016 and 2018.</p><h2>Is Yerry Mina a Muslim or a Christian?</h2><p>Fans are often interested in learning and exploring their favorite performers’ personal information, which they seldom divulge. One of the most contentious issues has been Yerry Mina’s faith. As a result, most people are curious if the player is Muslim or Christian. Mina is a committed Christian, to everyone’s surprise.&nbsp;Similarly, Yerry belongs to the neo-Pentecostal Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International. Unlike other athletes, he has been open about his religion with his supporters and has talked about it at church-sponsored events.</p><h2>Everything You Need to Know About Yerry Mina’s Family Ethnicity</h2><p><strong>Yerry Mina</strong> was born on September 23, 1994, to Jose Eulises Mina and Marianela Gonzalez. He was born and reared in the Colombian town of Guachene.&nbsp;There is no information on the ethnicity of the Mina family. Furthermore, no formal information on Yerry’s ethical background has been given by any of the websites.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yerry-Mina-1.jpg alt="Yerry Mina" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Similarly, Mina comes from an athletic family, as both his father and uncle were football goalkeepers. His father urged that Yerry try out for another post. Mina’s father and uncle wanted him to be the finest footballer possible, thus his uncle accompanied him to the trial of Deportivo Pasto. His brother, Juan Jose, on the other hand, is a footballer.&nbsp;Jair Mina, Yerry’s uncle, is his agent. Everton’s center-back is a devoted and caring son who pledged to offer a better life for his mother.&nbsp;His upbringing was far more difficult than everyone imagined, and Mina promised his mother that one day he would construct a home and provide nice food for his family.</p><h2>Meet Yerry Mina’s Wife Geraldine Molina</h2><p>Yerry Mina is a professional footballer who also has a family. Mina is happily married to Geraldine Molina, as previously stated.&nbsp;The couple has one child, a girl whose name cannot be revealed. The pair has yet to reveal the specifics and locations of their wedding; nevertheless, it has been claimed that Yerry and Geraldine are in a long-term relationship.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Yerry-Mina-2.jpg alt="Yerry Mina" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Geraldine met Yerry when he was playing for Deportivo Pasto.
