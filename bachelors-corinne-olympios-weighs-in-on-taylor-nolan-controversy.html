And I think we all now know who the real villain is here, which is what I was trying to tell everybody from the beginning,” Olympios, 29, began on <a href=#>Us Weekly’s “Here for the Right Reasons” podcast,</a> calling Nolan’s past social media activity “very alarming.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Corinne-Olympios-Reacts-to-Taylor-Nolan-Controversy-After-Bachelor-Feud.jpg><p>“While I don’t condone bullying at all, all I’m going to say is that I experienced on another level … that different side of her,” the <a href=#>AuraSugarCo</a> jewelry designer continued. “I did realize that there was something off there. And that’s just all I was trying to say from the beginning.”</p><p>Olympios and Nolan’s feud during <a href=#><strong>Nick Viall</strong></a>’s season of The Bachelor <a href=#>came to a head during a two-on-one date</a> when Nolan told Olympios she lacked “emotional intelligence.” Olympios subsequently questioned Nolan’s abilities as a mental health counselor.</p><p>“I don’t want to give myself any pats on the back for this because this is really a situation, [but] I did call it to a point,” the “Corinne Saves Us All” podcast host told Us.</p><p>Nolan, a licensed mental health counselor and psychotherapist, made headlines earlier this month for her past social media remarks, which ranged from 2011 to 2013. In addition to <a href=#>tweeting offensive comments about several different races,</a> she poked fun at suicide and shared fatphobic tweets. She has since apologized twice.</p><p>“There is no question or defending that every word of my old tweets are harmful, wrong, triggering and incredibly upsetting to the communities that I identify with and that I support. I’m so sorry to the folks that were triggered and re-traumatized by seeing the hurtful words from my past,” Nolan said on March 1 via Instagram.</p><p><strong>Us editors discuss Colton Underwood’s coming out in this Here for the Right Reasons podcast highlight!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>The Washington State Department of Health</a> later revealed that Nolan may be investigated after the DOH received “multiple complaints” against the Bachelor alum.</p><p>“Those complaints are under assessment. Patient safety is our top priority, and we take all complaints seriously,” DOH spokesperson Gordon MacCracken told Page Six in a statement, adding that “not all complaints lead to us opening cases.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2B0maaqKqZo7umec6lsKaomaTAbsPEop6hq12eu267zWarmrGcpL9uus6lmKdlk6S7tb7Or5yrq6lk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
