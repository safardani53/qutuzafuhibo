Not only is she an unbelievable singer, her resume spans far beyond that. She’s also an actress and fashion designer and her designs are so unique and beautiful. Our girl proved her major style chops on Nov. 29 when she rocked the red carpet at the&nbsp; FN Achievement Awards, wearing a shirt that has “securite” written across the back and chest, where she also showed off her nipples with no bra underneath.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Her matching black baseball cap and (of course) her FentyxPuma sneakers gave the outfit a sporty vibe while her blinged-out gloves, flowing skirt, and sparkling choker and massive emerald earrings by Chopard’s “High Jewelry Collection” upped the glam factor. We’ve never seen an outfit like this before but we must say, we’re into it!</p><h3><a href=#>Rihanna’s Fenty Puma Fashion Show — PICS From The Spring 2017 Runway</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Our sister site, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Footwear News</a>, has been the industry bible of the shoe business for more than 70 years, and they hosted the 30th FN Achievement Awards in NYC on Nov. 29.

Even though Rihanna is being awarded for her Creeper sneaker, she’s also gone above and beyond in shoe design. She made a ton of different shoe styles for FENTY PUMA by Rihanna, had a collaboration, RIHANNAxMANOLO, with <strong>Manolo Blahnik</strong>, and so much more.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The FN Achievement Awards are often referred to as the “Shoe Oscars,” and are sponsored by the Fashion Footwear Association of New York (FFANY), Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA), Zappos Luxury and Two Ten Footwear Foundation (Two Ten). Rihanna arrived on the red carpet and she absolutely stole the show in this gorgeous ensemble. RiRi never fails in the style department and we are not surprised that she showed up in this gorgeous outfit. She looked absolutely incredible!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>What did you guys think of Rihanna’s red carpet look — did you love it as much as we did?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5ye5FyZquhmJa7r62MqKytnpmpeqe7zq2unpmiYrumw9JmmLCZopnAbrLNZpicoJmaw6a5xKerZqiZmMBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
