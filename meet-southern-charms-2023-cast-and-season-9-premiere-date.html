The 2023 series will see Craig and his girlfriend, Paige DeSorbo, encounter obstacles as they figure out their next chapter.</p><p>The couple have been navigating their long-distance relationship and with Craig’s company, Sewing Down South, finding success in Charleston, the 34-year-old is hoping <a href=#>Summer House star Paige</a> will commit to the South.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shep-rose>Shep Rose</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/09/SC_S9_4x5_Shep-819x1024.jpg><p>Shep is known as Southern Charm’s bachelor but when he began dating Taylor, fans were convinced it was the real deal. Their unexpected break up came in the summer of 2022 after two-and-a-half years of dating.</p><p>However, there may still be lingering feelings as Austen announced in the trailer that “Shep and Taylor banged” and were later seen in bed together the next morning.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-austen-kroll>Austen Kroll</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/09/SC_S9_4x5_Austen-819x1024.jpg><p>Austen Kroll’s rumored hookup with Taylor Ann Green finds the pair in trouble with their respective exes, Olivia Flowers and Shep Rose. Kroll keeps viewers begging for more as he acknowledges “something happened” with Taylor in the trailer, but fails to spill the real tea.</p><p>Even Madison LeCroy, who dated Austen from 2018 to 2020 and is now married, wanted a straight-up answer: “Did you f*** Taylor or not?” – that is the golden question.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-ann-green>Taylor Ann Green</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/09/SC_S9_4x5_Taylor-819x1024.jpg><p>We definitely did not expect Taylor to be linked to not one, but two of her male co-stars. Does the cast not consider the awkwardness if things don’t work out?</p><p>Despite Austen claiming “something happened” with her, Green denied to Olivia Flowers that nothing went down. “Never, swear on my life,” the <a href=#>Bravo</a> celebrity said.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-madison-lecroy>Madison LeCroy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/09/SC_S9_4x5_Madison-819x1024.jpg><p><a href=#>Madison and her husband, Brett Randle</a>, married in November 2022 and are now looking to expand the family.

He has been in a relationship with his boyfriend, Tyler, since 2015; they are dog parents to four pups.</p><p>When he’s not tending to his fur babies, you’ll find him working at his interior design company, RAR Designs. He is also a floral designer.</p><p>So why did Bravo recruit him? Well, according to his profile, he keeps the group “grounded” as the voice of reason, which will be necessary for the clashes this season.</p><p>Patricia Altschul and her son, Whitney Sudler-Smith will also appear in the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=southern-charm%25c2%25a02023-premiere-date-confirmed>Southern Charm&nbsp;2023 premiere date confirmed</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Southern Charm season 9 will premiere on September 14 at 9pm ET/PT on Bravo with a “supersized” episode.

Their relationship played out in several seasons and they welcomed two children called Kensington and Saint. In March 2021, it was reported that Ravenel held temporary primary custody and he relocated with their children to Aiken, which is three hours away from Charleston, for a quieter life.</p><p>In May 2023, The US Sun reported that Kathryn lost full custody due to “multiple failed drug tests”.</p><p>Ravenel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> his win to All About The Tea:</p><p>“I was awarded sole custody.
