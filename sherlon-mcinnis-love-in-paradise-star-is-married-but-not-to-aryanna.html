Finally.</p><p>It was clear to Love in Paradise: The Caribbean viewers that they had little in common, and at times struggled to simply get along.</p><p>When you factor in Sherlon’s obvious reluctance to commit to, well, anything, of course they split.</p><p>But that also makes it a little surprising to hear that Sherlon is now married. And no, it’s not to the mother of his child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Season 2 of 90 Day Fiance: Love in Paradise filmed well over a year ago, in November 2021. At that point, Aryanna Sierra and Sherlon McInnis were still together. Sort of.</p><p>Aryanna flew to Jamaica with their son, Odin. The hope was that she and Sherlon could work on commitment issues and figure out a plan. After all, they share a child.</p><p>And her fear was that Sherlon was not only unwilling to commit to a future as a family — but actively seeing other women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sherlon ended up confirming some of Aryanna’s fears. He even confessed to “misleading” her early on.</p><p>“When we just met, it was all fun, you know, that was it for me and I didn’t take it as seriously as Aryanna,” we heard him admit during an episode last summer.</p><p>Sherlon then added: “We are tied because of Odin.” A child does not guarantee a lasting relationship, let alone a healthy one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Sherlon confided to the camera that he had set about “charming” Aryanna “to think” that he was willing to commit.</p><p>“And I didn’t really mean it. But when she got pregnant, s–t got complicated,” he went on.</p><p>Sherlon then fully admitted that “I couldn’t just run away like I normally do.” Obviously, this was not a recipe for long-term happiness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Late last year, it became extremely clear that Sherlon, who shared this (above) post, was no longer with Aryanna.</p><p>He posted passive-aggressive stuff. According to Aryanna, it was an effort to get ahead of the story.</p><p>Why? Aryanna says that he’s a total deadbeat dad who doesn’t call or provide for their son, Odin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In August of last year, Sherlon went Instagram official with a mystery woman.</p><p>This was only nine months after Aryanna’s last visit to him in Jamaica.</p><p>He did not, and has not, revealed her identity in any public post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Fans of the show felt a sense of whiplash. While many were critical of Aryanna (90 Day Fiance viewers are notorious for some misogynistic biases), many also felt that Aryanna “deserved better.”</p><p>Aryanna weighed in, noting that Sherlon was going on dates “with the $$$$ he made on TV.”</p><p>“But,” she continued, Sherlon “hasn’t seen his son in weeks or spent ANY money on Odin.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Then, in December of 2022, Sherlon stunned fans and followers with an announcement: he is now a married man!</p><p>“#married#mr& Mrs McInnis#islandthing#,” Sherlon announced on December 15.</p><p>We still do not know much about his new bride, but she is certainly not Aryanna. Her name is Ashley.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Fast forward a few weeks and, this month, Aryanna alleged that Sherlon’s new wife had sent her a nasty DM.</p><p>“When do you guys think Sherlon’s wife will stop making fake accounts and leave us alone?” Aryanna asked her own followers.</p><p>She then declared that: “This is why neither of them will ever be around Odin ever.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2V%2BcL%2FHnqmlp55iuqS1zaegrGWcpMOmecinZKmZopaxqr%2FEZqqtmaJitrR5zJqpq6GVmXqjwdNmpaisXam8bq3RspinppFk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
