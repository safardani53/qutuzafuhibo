Deadpool 3 is currently in the works, and Disney has confirmed a brand-new release date for the movie. In a shocking turn, Deadpool 3 will arrive sooner than expected.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Deadpool got his own movie in 2016 which grossed over $782 million at the worldwide box office and was warmly received by critics. The sequel,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadpool 2</a>, came out two years later and earned over $785 million worldwide with positive critic responses. Both films are rated R and break the fourth wall. Deadpool/Wade Wilson is a former special forces operative-turned-mercenary who takes a serum that gives him mutant genes. Ryan has become synonymous with the Deadpool character. Fans are pumped for the third film, especially because <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hugh Jackman</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>returning as Wolverine</a>, and a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>new set photo</a> shows Hugh wearing Wolverine’s iconic blue and yellow suit from the comics.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>There are also rumors that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taylor Swift</a>&nbsp;</strong>will make a cameo appearance! But for now, it has been confirmed&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jennifer Garner </a></strong>will return as Elektra for the first time in the franchise. Also, it’s the first Deadpool movie to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Here’s everything you need to know about Deadpool 3, including the release date, the cast, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/deadpool-3-hugh-jackman-embed1.jpg><h2>Deadpool 3 Release Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The third Deadpool movie will be released in theaters on May 3, 2024, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. The previous release date was <span>November 8, 2024. The original release date was September 6, 2024, but it was delayed. Ryan confirmed that the official title for the superhero flick is </span>Deadpool 3<span>. After its theatrical run, the film is expected to be available to stream on </span><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Disney+,</a><span> which is home to the first two&nbsp;</span>Deadpool&nbsp;<span>movies.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Filming for Deadpool 3 began around May 2023, according to director <strong>Shawn Levy</strong>. “On or about. Yep,” Shawn told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Collider</a>. “The truth is the more digitally CG-heavy a movie is, the longer time you need in post. But obviously it’s the first Deadpool&nbsp;movie in the MCU. There’s going to be no lack of visual effects. But it’s also a North Star priority for Ryan and I to keep&nbsp;Deadpool raw, gritty, grounded in the ways that those movies have been and that all of us love.”</p><h2>Deadpool 3 Cast & Crew</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine will lead the cast of Deadpool 3. <strong>Leslie Uggams&nbsp;</strong>is expected to return as Blind Al, Deadpool’s roommate and BFF. Other cast members who could return for the third film include <strong>Josh Brolin</strong> as Cable,&nbsp;<strong>Zazie Beatz&nbsp;</strong>as Domino, <strong>Brianna Hildebrand</strong> as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and more. Since this is the first&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;movie to be set in the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, there’s also a chance we see characters from any of the MCU movies.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jennifer Garner was reported to be playing Elektra, a skilled assassin and bounty hunter, by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a> on July 7, 2023. It will be the first time the beloved actress will play Elektra in nearly 20 years. She starred in her own Elektra movie in 2005.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Succession star <strong>Matthew Macfadyen</strong> has also joined the cast of Deadpool 3, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. Details about his character are currently unknown. The Emmy winner plays Tom Wambsgans in the hit series <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Succession</a>, which aired its <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>final season</a> in spring 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/emma-corrin-on-deadpool-cast-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emma Corrin</strong></a> will make their MCU debut as one of the film’s villains, but it has yet to be revealed what their character will be. The actor was a hit in their starring role as <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Princess Diana</a>&nbsp;</strong>in the Netflix series&nbsp;The Crown. Ryan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> welcoming them to the film franchise. “New addition to the family! The Deadpool family, for clarity. Which is just like a real family except with less swearing… Welcome, Emma Corrin!” he wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>There have also been rumors that Taylor Swift, who is <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>good friends with Ryan</a> and his wife <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>, could appear in&nbsp;Deadpool 3. The theories started when fans noticed that Ryan and Hugh’s Deadpool 3&nbsp;teaser was actually shot in the same house Taylor filmed her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>All Too Well: The Short Film</a>.&nbsp;Ryan told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;in Nov. 2022 that Taylor won’t be in the movie, but that he would “of course” be open to working with the pop star.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“Are you kidding me? I would do anything for that woman. She’s a genius,” he said.

Shawn previously worked with Ryan on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Free Guy</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Adam Project</a>. He’s also an executive producer on Netflix’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stranger Things</a>.&nbsp;Bob’s Burgers&nbsp;screenwriters&nbsp;<strong>Wendy Molyneux</strong> and <strong>Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin&nbsp;</strong>are writing Deadpool 3 with&nbsp;<strong>Rhett Reese</strong> and <strong>Paul Wernick</strong>, who wrote the first two films.</p><h2>Is Hugh Jackman Returning As Wolverine In Deadpool 3?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Yes, Hugh is playing Logan/Wolverine again for Deadpool 3. Ryan basically broke the internet when he announced this news on Sept. 27. “Hey everyone, we’re extremely sad to have missed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>D23</a>, but we’ve been working very hard on the next Deadpool film for a good long while now,” Ryan&nbsp;said at the beginning of the social media video. “I’ve had to really search my soul on this one. His first appearance in the MCU obviously needs to feel special. We need to stay true to the character, find new depth, motivation, meaning.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yeah, sure. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/LaSBjDeLjI</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>— Hugh Jackman (@RealHughJackman) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 27, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Then, Ryan revealed that the&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;team decided to bring back Wolverine. “Hey, Hugh, you want to play Wolverine one more time?” he asked as Hugh nonchalantly walked by behind him. “Yeah, sure, Ryan,” Hugh replied.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Hugh first portrayed Wolverine, the Marvel comic book character with Adamantium metal claws, in 2000’s X-Men&nbsp;and went on to portray him in nine films, the last being 2017’s&nbsp;Logan. The beloved character died in&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;(SPOILER ALERT!), but Ryan and Hugh confirmed that Wolverine’s passing isn’t being undone by&nbsp;Deadpool 3. “Logan takes place in 2029. Totally separate thing. Logan died in Logan. Not touching that,” Ryan said in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a second video</a>. It’s possible Hugh is playing a different iteration of Logan/Wolverine thanks to the multiverse in the MCU.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Hugh appeared on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-ml-dynamic=true data-ml-dynamic-type=sl data-orig-url=https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-empire-film-podcast/id507987292 data-ml-id=1 data-ml=true data-xid=fr1672249545203jij data-skimlinks-tracking=xid:fr1672249545203jij data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Empire Film Podcast</a>&nbsp;in December 2022 and revealed that Deadpool and Wolverine “hate each other” in the third film. “How do I categorize it? Ten being really close, zero being the reality: we’re zero; we’re opposites, hate each other,” the actor explained. “I’m just talking from my perspective. [Logan is] frustrated by him [and] wants to be a million miles away from him or wants to punch him in the head. Unfortunately, he can’t be a million miles away from him in this movie, so I’m probably going to punch him in the head a lot.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/deadpool-3-hugh-jackman-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-19>On July 10, Ryan and Hugh shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> from the film of Hugh dressed in Wolverine’s yellow and blue suit.

This will be a game-changing movie for the franchise since it’s now part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney acquired 21st Century Fox back in 2019, thus obtaining the rights to the Deadpool&nbsp;and&nbsp;X-Men&nbsp;franchises. That allowed for <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Patrick Stewart</strong></a>‘s Professor Charles Xavier to appear in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Doctor&nbsp;Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i></a>.&nbsp;Now, Deadpool exists in the same universe as beloved MCU characters like <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Elizabeth Olsen</strong></a>‘s Wanda Maximoff, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Paul Rudd</strong></a>‘s Ant-Man, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brie Larson</strong></a>‘s Captain Marvel, and more.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Deadpool 3&nbsp;writers <strong>Rhett Reese</strong> and <strong>Paul Wernick</strong> teased the third movie back in 2019 and spoke about how Deadpool will be integrated into the MCU.</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>“There’s a lot to be sorted out, like how Deadpool fits into the Marvel Universe with the other characters and into the release schedule of the MCU,” Paul told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Den of Geek</a>. “Then it’s, do the X-Men get in there at some point? Fantastic Four? There’s a lot to be sorted out and I think we’re all getting a much-needed rest from Deadpool — Ryan and us and everybody.” Rhett added, “The promise is that there will be more Deadpool. He will live in the R-rated universe that we’ve created, and hopefully we’ll be allowed to play a little bit in the MCU sandbox as well and incorporate him into that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OemJ2on6S5bn%2BMbW9ubGNshXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
