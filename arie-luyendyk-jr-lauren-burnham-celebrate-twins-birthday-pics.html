One year after <a href=#><strong>Arie Luyendyk Jr.</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lauren Burnham</strong> </a>welcomed <a href=#>their boy-girl twins</a>, they went all out to <a href=# rel>celebrate their latest milestone</a>: Turning 1.</p><p class=p1>“Happy birthday&nbsp;to my sweet, sweet loves,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Bachelor</a>&nbsp;</i>runner-up, 30, gushed via<a href=#> Instagram</a> on Saturday, June 11. “Our life may be a circus, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world. <span class=s1>🎪</span>&nbsp;Love you so much!”</p><p class=p1>Burnham and the former race car driver, 40, set up an at-home circus to celebrate <a href=#>Lux and Senna</a>, both 12 months, over the weekend. The twins, who wore glittery crowns throughout the party, enjoyed performances by an aerialist and a tightrope walker before playing in a ball pit with their older sister <a href=#>Alessi</a>, 2. The twins also tasted their own smash cakes that were decorated with circus animals.</p><p class=p1>“Welcome to the circus!&nbsp;<span class=s1>🎪</span>&nbsp;We had such an amazing day celebrating Lux and Senna’s 1st b-day&nbsp;<span class=s1>🎉</span> Love you two so much,” the real estate agent wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Saturday.</p><p class=p1>The Shades of Rose designer — who <a href=#>wed the former Bachelor in January 2019</a> after appearing on his season of the ABC franchise — <a href=#>gave birth to their twins in June 2021</a> after previously <a href=#>suffering a miscarriage</a>.</p><p class=p1>“The babies are just very different,” Luyendyk Jr. <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;in February</a> of their little ones’ latest milestones. “They have different personalities. … Our son is sort of like a little bulldozer. He’s such a boy. Our girl is, like, all smiles with her whole body. It’s really cute to see that’s already taking shape at such a young age, and I can already kind of envision the next couple of years.”</p><p class=p1>After noting that Lux was “definitely” reaching milestones before his twin sister, the married couple opened up about how Alessi, born in May 2019, had <a href=#>adjusted to becoming a big sister</a>.</p><p class=p1>“She was our whole world and then the babies came along, so there’s a little adjustment,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Bachelorette</i></a>&nbsp;alum told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>at the time. “She would act out in the beginning, but she’s done really well. She really is a good big sister already. She’s very nurturing and sweet. We just make sure to take time for her as well and that helps.”</p><p class=p1>While the Netherlands native <a href=#>underwent a vasectomy earlier this year</a>, his wife<a href=#> isn’t quite ready to decide if their family is complete</a> as is.</p><p class=p1>“I wasn’t necessarily ready to close that chapter yet just because, I know it’s hard right now [with three kids under 3], but once we’re out of this space, I might want another one,” the Virginia native <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>later in February</a>. “Who knows?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Her husband added: “They’re reversible if we have some heartaches in five years’ time. This is the first time we’ve ever really felt an age gap. She’s 30, and <a href=#>I have a little bit of a different outlook</a>. I want to be a younger dad. I’m not a young dad, but I don’t want to be an even older dad than I am now.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see party photos from Lux and Senna’s special day:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkrrO1xGajrrGVo7G6t4yjqWakkaq%2FprqMm6yrppiWum6vxKWcm6qRqbJuwNaipaxlkp6%2FtbTDmrBmqJmYwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
