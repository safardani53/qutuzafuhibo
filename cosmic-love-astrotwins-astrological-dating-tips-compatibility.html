[Air, Fire, Water, Earth], if you memorize those, because the way humans act in the world is a lot how those elements operate.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Astrology">Read More on Astrology</h2><p>She continued: “That’s what I always recommend for people.&nbsp;</p><p>“Find their element, and then you at least have one in four chances of it blending together.”</p><p>As such, The AstroTwins, who have written multiple books and also share advice on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their website</a>, focused on one's elements as the top priority while creating their new Amazon dating show, Cosmic Love.</p><p>The series, which released on Friday, follows as “four individuals attempt to find their perfect spouse via astrological matchmaking,” with each of the stars representing “one of the four elements of astrology (Air, Fire, Water, Earth).”&nbsp;</p><p>The official synopsis continues: “Their romantic adventure takes place at a retreat run by a mystical guide, the Astro Chamber.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>“They mingle, match, date, eliminate, and eventually make the biggest decision of their lives… will they marry their match, based solely on their astrology?”</p><p>Maria Rodriguez is the Earth element, Phoebe Davis the Fire element, Connor Shennan the Air, and Noel Allen the Water.</p><p>Taking into account their element, as well as more their more specific zodiac signs, astrologers Ophira and Tali worked to find them a selection of possible matches.</p><p>While the women shared that the easiest and best way for someone to use astrology when looking into a first date is simply to go with one’s elements, they used much more than that for casting this show.</p><p>They looked into the time, date, and place of birth for each of the four singles and then did the same to find their potential love matches.</p><p>Along with this information, Tali shared they also looked at Venus and Mars signs and used “a little bit of intuitive energy that you can feel from people.”</p><p>To take things a step further, The AstroTwins then created “a composite chart, a blended chart, to see how their charts combined into one” and if certain contestants would make a good pair.</p><p>Despite having all of the necessary information in front of them, that doesn’t mean the casting process wasn’t without its complications.</p><p>Namely, The AstroTwins explained, there were some arguments over determining the compatibility over matches, as there are lots of give and take in deciphering charts.</p><p>Ophi admitted: “We had a couple of debates, back and forth, because with the chart there are different facets.&nbsp;</p><p>“So, some things can be compatible, while others can't. That's true with any two charts.”</p><p>She continued: “You kind of have to weigh the pros and cons. Like, 'OK, these two people will be attracted to each other, but actually this one maybe needs to grow a little more in this area.'&nbsp;</p><p>"We definitely had some colorful discussions.”</p><p>In the end, after looking at over a hundred possible contestants and their astrological charts, they were able to narrow it down to 16 – with four compatible contenders for each of the four cast members.</p><p>With all of the stars of the show selected, The AstroTwins continued to use their astrology expertise throughout the show to help guide the singles to their matches.</p><p>Instead of the duo appearing in front of the four main individuals to offer up their advice, the show features uses a mystical room, the Astro Chamber, to do their bidding.&nbsp;</p><p>With a massive orb in the middle of the galaxy-looking room, the cast members take turns seeking guidance that will help them on their love journey.</p><p>While all of the advice was created by Ophi and Tali, the mystical voice in the show that shares the information is actually actress Cree Summer.</p><p>Though, her voice wasn’t actually added until after the episodes were shot.</p><p>Ophi revealed: “It was voiced over in the final production, but during the filming of the show, it was all us talking to the people through an earpiece.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>They decided to do it this way because they thought the “special effects, mystical, larger-than-life orb” would be the best way to translate the “language” of astrology.</p><p>Reality dating show and astrology fans alike can now watch all episodes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmic Love season 1</a> on Amazon Prime Video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000752957182.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000752957145.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htaW1%2BdoKYaJqoq52esG64zq%2BcZpmjqb%2BwwNaipaxlkajBs7vLqJ6im5GheqWt06KloGWknr20ecKopKmZpJ6vqrjIrbBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
