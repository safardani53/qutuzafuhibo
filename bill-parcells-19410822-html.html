He emerged as the head coach of the New York Giants, the team to which he led to two Super Bowl titles. Parcells continues to be the head coach of the New England Patriots, New York Jets and the Dallas Cowboys. Throughout his career, he coached teams that were in decline and turned them into playoff contenders. He is the only coach in NFL history to lead four teams into the knockout stages and three teams into a conference championship match. When Parcells became the Giants' head coach in 1983, he took over the franchise to make it to the knockout stages only once in the past decade and only had a winning record in the last 10 seasons. Parcells brought new success to the team and, in four years, led them to their first Super Bowl victory.</p><table class=wikibox readability=3><tr><td class=wk_label>Position</td><td class=wk_value>Courtesy consultant</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Date of birth</td><td class=wk_value>August 22, 1941</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Place of birth</td><td class=wk_value>Englewood, New Jersey</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>High school</td><td class=wk_value>River Dell, (Oradell, New Jersey)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>College</td><td class=wk_value>Wichita State</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>NFL Draft</td><td class=wk_value>1964 / Round: 7/ Pick: 89</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Regular season</td><td class=wk_value>172–130–1 (.000)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Postseason</td><td class=wk_value>11–8 (.000)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Career</td><td class=wk_value>183–138–1 (.000)</td></tr></table><p>Football Coach Bill Parcells was born on August 22, 1941 in Englewood, New Jersey, United States (He's 82 years old now).</p><p>In the NFL, he coached three conference championships and two Super Bowls.
