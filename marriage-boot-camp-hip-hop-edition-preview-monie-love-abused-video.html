Dr. Ish wants to know why she hasn’t been open about this before. Monie says it’s because she’s never sat down and revealed how “hurt” she was. The abuse went on for 3 years, and she’s never told the story in public before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/marriage-boot-camp-preview-monie-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“The one person I shared that with is Tuff,” Monie admits. Dr. Ish asks if Tuff “honored” or “added” to her pain. She whispers, “He added.” Tuff is devastated.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Knowing that I added to that doesn’t sit well to me,” Tuff says in the preview. “In the beginning, I thought I could protect her from that. What I didn’t realize was that I couldn’t protect her from me. I knew I would never harm her physically, but I never really understood that I could still hurt her mentally.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>When Monie and Tuff first entered the house, Monie was upfront about how Tuff has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cheating on her</a>. She admitted that if Tuff doesn’t stop cheating on her, then she’s going to have to end things between them for good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/marriage-boot-camp-preview-monie-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The synopsis for the October 21 episode reads, “The couples confront how the public perceives them and how they see each other.
