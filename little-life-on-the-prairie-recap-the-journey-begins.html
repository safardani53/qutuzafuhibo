It’s a big deal."</p><p>It’s a very very big deal, but it’s also one the couple thinks will be worthwhile.</p><p>"Our journey to grow our family has had a lot of heartbreak,” Nate added on air. “We pretty much sunk a majority of our life savings into this process to get a child to bring home."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Thankfully, Nate and Lauren do have one child already…</p><p>… and she is SO very cute!</p><p>On this episode, Juniper starts ballet, beyond excited to try on her shoes and tights.</p><p>Her parents are excited for her as well, but also afraid she’ll be made fun of for her condition and that Juniper will soon have it tough because she doesn’t know she has&nbsp;achondroplasia.</p><p>She doesn’t know she will not grow up to be an average size person.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/little-life-on-the-prairie-picture.png><p>Nate remembers being pushed in the pool when he was little just because he was different.</p><p>Lauren admits that junior high was a challenge from on her.</p><p>Both come from families of big people and sort of had to adjust on their own as kids.</p><p>Fortunately for Juniper, she has a mother and a father who can relate to her situation and be there for her when she has questions or concerns.</p><p>On the way to ballet, Lauren is nervous, but Juniper is simply psyched — and, in the end, all goes very well on her first day.</p><p><strong>Little Life on the Prairie airs Mondays at 10/9c on TLC.
