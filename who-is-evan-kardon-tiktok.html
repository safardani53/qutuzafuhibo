Touting himself as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">power lifter and bodybuilder</a>, he posts regularly about his gym accomplishments, including mirror selfies and lifting videos.

He even runs a YouTube channel where he posts compilations of his TikTok content.</p><p>His brags aren't exactly humble, though. Many of his videos involve him flexing his lifting abilities on other fitness TikTokers.</p><p>His content can come off as harsh and unwelcoming, especially when more often than not, he is physically stronger than most of them. In fact, most of his videos have their comment sections restricted only to mutual followers if the section is even open in the first place.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As far as gym bros go, he seems to be more "gym" than "bro" as far as influencers go.
