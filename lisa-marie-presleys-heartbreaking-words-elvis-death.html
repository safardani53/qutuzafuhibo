I'd seen it happen many times before and I didn't panic.</p><p>"She told me people were with him, so I told my friend I'd run him home, because I suspected we may have to cancel a tour or make some arrangements.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"Anyway after dropping him off nearby, as I drove back into the gates of Graceland, an ambulance pulled in before me.</p><p>"They went to the front of the house and I drove to the back, and I started getting nervous. I didn't panic because I'd pulled him out of a dozen overdose situations.</p><p>"I ran up the steps, into his room, the bathroom where Elvis was laying in the fetal position...I saw his face buried in the carpet."</p><span class=quote-credit>David E Stanley, Elvis's stepbrother</span><p>"I ran up the steps, into his room, the bathroom where Elvis was laying in the fetal position. Vernon was at his feet moaning: 'My son is dead'.</p><p>"I saw his face buried in the carpet. I don't know whether he fell off the toilet when he had his heart attack."</p><p>Paramedics then rushed Elvis to hospital but doctors were unable to save him.</p><h2>'I WAS A WRECK'</h2><p>In previous interviews, Lisa Marie has revealed how her dad kissed her and put her to bed the night before he died, then she woke up and realized something was wrong.</p><p>In a TV interview, Lisa Marie recalled: "I knew something was wrong, because I was in my room which was right next to his bathroom.</p><p>“So I knew that something was very wrong. All the commotion and everything. I was a wreck."</p><p>She added: "I was a mess, but I was also confused because I was so upset."</p><p>Elvis had a <a href=#>well-known drug addiction</a> before he died and was known to take sleeping pills, Demerol injections, amphetamines, codeine, morphine, diazepam and Placidyl.</p><h2>DEPTHS OF ADDICTION</h2><p>Post-mortem tests showed Elvis's blood contained 10 different types of drugs and he was suffering from advanced cardiovascular disease, emphysema and bowel disorders.</p><p>It was later discovered that the King was prescribed a massive 8,805 pills and injectable drugs in the months before his death.</p><p>David said he recalls how Elvis <a href=#>descended into addiction</a> after his manager Colonel Tom Parker, played by Hanks in the <a href=#>new movie Elvis,</a> forced him to work a grueling schedule and dashed his dreams of starring in Hollywood movies and touring Europe.</p><p>While David is clear not to blame Parker for his brother's death, he does feel he contributed to Elvis's downward spiral.</p><p>David said: "One of the reasons that Elvis passed away when he did was that he wasn't challenged anymore. He needed a new challenge.</p><h2>HOLLYWOOD DREAMS</h2><p>"There was a guy in the Middle East who offered him a million cash for Elvis to do one show and an Australian promoter offered millions for shows there. But Parker turned them down.</p><p>"Elvis was approached about working with Barbra Streisand on the Star Is Born film in the mid-70s.</p><p>"He wants to do it, to show he could cut his teeth with the best of Hollywood.</p><p>Elvis got stuck doing these revolving US tours, where sure we were making a lot of money, but they were holding him back.</p><span class=quote-credit>David E Stanley, Elvis's stepbrother</span><p>"He loved the challenge, the script and the thought of working alongside Barbra. But Parker nixed that too.</p><p>"Elvis would have done a great job too. He had the potential to be a major film star - no doubt about it.</p><p>"He needed a goal and creative project like that to get him going.</p><p>"Instead Elvis got stuck doing these revolving US tours, where sure we were making a lot of money, but they were holding him back.</p><p>"Colonel kept Elvis from developing. It restricted him and made him feel like he was stuck in this never-ever cycle of US tours.&nbsp;</p><p>"As a kid, I voiced my opinions but nothing changed.</p><p>"The bigger question is what did he have on Elvis to make him to succumb to his wishes. There had to be something. I don't know what that was. Still to this day, I cannot figure out."</p><p>David&nbsp;wrote a book about his life with Elvis entitled My Brother Elvis: The Final Years.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>He is also re-releasing a film he made called Protecting the King, which examines Elvis’s last five years alive.</p><p>The Sun contacted the Elvis Presley Charitable Foundation at Graceland for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000742132711-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000742374811.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000460903476-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000742108380-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000742106943-3.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htZmeBeoSPaKOiq5FiuqK%2ByJ5kqaqVqLmmxdJmn56Zoqmvs7HApKCnn12svLOw0macpa6ZqHqlscCtn2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
