At least 1,200 to 1,500 mourners, including <strong>Kimora Lee Simmons, Mary J. Blige, Dallas Austin, Yolanda Adams, Faith Evans, Winnie Harlow,</strong> and more stars, attended the service before Kim was buried next to her mother,&nbsp;<strong>Sarah Lee Porter</strong>, who died in 2014. Diddy spoke, while Yolanda and Faith performed and&nbsp;<strong>Bishop Noel Jones</strong>&nbsp;delivered the eulogy, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. See all the photos in our gallery above.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The night before (Nov. 23), Kim’s two sons and Diddy were pictured leaving her private wake&nbsp;in Georgia.&nbsp;<strong>Quincy Brown</strong> and <strong>Christian Casey Combs</strong> attended the private service at Charles E. Huff’s International Funeral Home in Columbus alongside friends and family. It was during this time that Diddy was seen clutching the hand of a relative. In a joint statement provided to TMZ by Kim and Diddy’s joint families, they said, “God broke the mold when he made Kim, there was truly no other woman like her. Although her time here on earth was far too short, she lived a life full of purpose and meaning. She was a loving mother and devoted friend.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>And moments before the funeral on Saturday, Diddy also took to Instagram to pay tribute to Kim. “Today we lay to rest our ANGEL. Her spirit lives on with us FOREVER!!! We thank you all for your prayers and support. You have no idea how much it means to us. We thank GOD for all of you.&nbsp;#KimPorter,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/diddy-kimora-lee-simmons-more-look-heartbroken-arriving-at-kim-porters-funeral-e28093-see-pics-post-1.jpg alt width=620 height=930 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/diddy-kimora-lee-simmons-more-look-heartbroken-arriving-at-kim-porters-funeral-e28093-see-pics-post-2.jpg alt width=620 height=930 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>As we previously shared with you, Kim died at the age of 47.
