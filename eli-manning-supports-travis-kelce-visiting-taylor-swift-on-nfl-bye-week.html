His break coincides with the beginning of Swift’s international leg of The Eras Tour, <a href=#>which officially began in Argentina on Thursday.</a></p><p>“I think for him to travel, there’s nothing wrong with traveling, going somewhere,” Manning noted. “Hey, if he wants to go and support his girlfriend and see her play a concert, I’ve got no problem with that.”</p><p>Manning clarified that teams in the NFL get “about four or five days” off during the bye. “It’s a time to get away from football,” he said. “It’s a long season.”</p><p>Reflecting on how he spent his bye weeks <a href=#>during his time playing for the New York Giants</a>, Manning said, “I might go back to my college, watch a game if they had a big game or go see my parents.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eli-Manning-Supports-Travis-Kelce-Visiting-Taylor-Swift-During-NFL-Bye-Week-2.jpg><p>Earlier this week, Kelce <a href=#>hinted that he might be making plans to fly</a> out to see Swift in South America.</p><p>“I might just say ‘f–k it’ and just go somewhere nice, I don’t know. My skin’s getting real pale. I gotta go somewhere sunny,” he said on the Wednesday, November 8, episode of his “New Heights” podcast with brother<a href=#><strong> Jason Kelce</strong></a>.</p><p>Jason, 36, questioned <a href=#>whether his younger sibling was going “someplace south,”</a> to which Travis responded, “Closer to the equator.”</p><p>While Travis <a href=#>missed Swift’s first show in Buenos Aires</a> on Thursday, instead opting to attend a charity event organized by his teammate<a href=#><strong> Patrick Mahomes</strong></a> in Kansas City,&nbsp;he was spotted arriving in Argentina on Friday, November 10. Swift has two more concerts in Buenos Aires before she heads to Brazil.</p><p>As their schedules ramp up, a source exclusively told Us Weekly about Travis and Swift’s <a href=#>plans to conquer long-distance dating.</a></p><p>“Travis and Taylor are a very real couple, they actually spend a lot of one-on-one time together and have developed a very real connection,” the insider shared earlier this month. “They have very detailed plans coming up on how to stay together while she’s on tour and he has games.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Travis <a href=#>initially attended an Eras Tour stop in Missouri</a> in July, revealing on “New Heights” later that month that he tried — and failed — to trade phone numbers with Swift at the concert. He subsequently invited Swift <a href=#>to see him play in a Chiefs game, and the pair sparked romance rumors</a> when she took him up on the offer in September. She has since attended several of Travis’ games and openly bonded with his family.</p><p>“They’re really happy. They’re not saying they’re in love yet. But it’s obvious to her friends they’re heading in that direction,” a second insider shared with Us last month. “Friends think they’re in love.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaepJliuqK6zaKloGWjqr2xu9GtqmasopbDqr%2BMpJylm5Viw6q%2FyK2gp59dqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbrvNZqWfpF2XxqZ51p6cpGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
