(Harry, 39, and Meghan, 42, share son <a href=#>Archie</a>, 4, and daughter <a href=#>Lilibet</a>, 2.)</p><p>The source continued: “Charles has <a href=#>missed speaking to his grandkids</a> as well as Meghan and Harry, holding onto this grudge hasn’t been something that’s been good for either side and they are all looking forward to the future and a better relationship as a family.”</p><p>Days before Charles’ birthday on Tuesday, November 14, news broke that Harry, 39, would <a href=#>not be in attendance</a> at the monarch’s London celebration. “In response to UK media headlines, there has been no contact regarding an invitation to His Majesty’s upcoming birthday,” a spokesperson for Harry told Us on November 6.</p><p>At the time, a second source claimed that Harry declined an invite to the event, which was held at Clarence House on Tuesday. <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate Middleton</strong></a> were <a href=#>photographed leaving the party</a> with smiles on their faces. Kate, 41, sported a sparkling emerald gown to the celebration while William, also 41, opted for a classic black blazer and white shirt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Prince-Harry-and-Meghan-Markle-s-Birthday-Phone-Call-to-Charles-Was-Big-Step-in-Healing-Relationship-112.jpg><p>Other royal attendees included <a href=#><strong>Queen Camilla</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Princess Beatrice</strong></a>, <a href=#>Princess Margaret</a>’s daughter, <strong>Lady Sarah Chatto</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Princess Anne</strong></a>’s daughter, <a href=#><strong>Zara Tindall</strong></a>, and Zara’s husband <a href=#><strong>Mike</strong></a>.</p><p>While the couple were noticeably missing from the Prince and Princess of Wales’ <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> tribute to Charles, the royal family’s <a href=# rel=noopener>birthday post</a> featured several snaps of Harry and Charles together over the years. “👑🎂 Wishing His Majesty The King a happy 75th birthday,” the palace captioned the Instagram upload.</p><p>Tensions between <a href=#>Harry and Meghan and the royal family</a> came to a head (again) earlier this year following the release of Harry’s bombshell memoir, <a href=#>Spare</a>. In the book, the Duke of Sussex made <a href=#>many revelations about his family</a>, including claiming that <a href=#>Charles would often joke</a> that the late <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>’s lover <a href=#><strong>Major James Hewitt</strong></a> was Harry’s real father.</p><p>Harry also recalled a tense conversation with William and Charles after <a href=#>Prince Philip</a>‘s <a href=#>funeral in September 2021</a>, during which the pair confessed they didn’t understand why he and Meghan chose to <a href=#>step down from royal duties</a> and leave the U.K.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Prince-Harry-and-Meghan-Markle-s-Birthday-Phone-Call-to-Charles-Was-Big-Step-in-Healing-Relationship-111.jpg><p>Royal expert <a href=#><strong>Christopher Andersen</strong></a> told <a href=#>Us</a> in July that the royal family “does not want another kid writing a book,” adding, “Obviously, Harry was very hurt by <a href=#>being in the shadow of his brother</a>.
