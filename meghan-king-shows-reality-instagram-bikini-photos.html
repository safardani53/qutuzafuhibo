King paired the look with a gray bucket hat, showing off her figure with the slight physical differences between two photos.</p><p>“You made it through Monday, let it all hang out 😵🥳,” she continued. “Also&nbsp;new 🍈 🍈 coming soon! Ten years and three babies and mommy wants to&nbsp;see a 👩🏻‍⚕️🔪. How do we feel ab this?”</p><p>One of those “babies” — <a href=#>daughter Aspen, 5</a> — was seen in the corner of the pic in an adorable pink, strawberry-printed bathing suit, smiling with her mom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Meghan-King-Shows-Reality-of-Before-and-After-Bikini-Photos-02.jpg><p>The former reality TV star shares her daughter and twin sons Hart and Hayes, 4, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Jim Edmonds</strong></a>. The former pair called it quits in October 2019 amid rumors the former baseball player <a href=#>had cheated</a>. Edmonds, 52, denied the claims, telling Us Weekly at the time, “Regrettably, I had a lapse in judgment. I engaged in an inappropriate conversation with this person. At no time was there any type of relationship or physical contact. Absolutely none.”</p><p>Edmonds moved on with <a href=#><strong>Kortnie O’Connor</strong></a>, to whom he proposed in August 2021 after he and King finalized their divorce in May 2021.</p><p>The blogger also moved on, dating businessman <a href=#><strong>Christian Schauf</strong></a> for seven months in 2020 and longtime friend <strong>Will Roos</strong> for less than a year in 2021. After their romance fizzled out, King married <strong><a href=#>President </a></strong><a href=#><strong>Joe Biden</strong></a>’s nephew <strong>Cuffe Owens</strong> in October 2021. Their union was over in less than three months, however, and was officially annulled in July.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=#><strong>Caroline Stanbury</strong></a> on her “<a href=#>Divorce Not Dead</a>” podcast on Wednesday, July 13, King reflected on her various ups and downs with the father of her three children, sharing that they have “[a worse] relationship” than when they separated.</p><p>“It’s horrible. It’s so detrimental for the kids [and] for us as individuals,” the former “Intimate Knowledge” podcaster told the <a href=#>Ladies of London</a> alum, 46, adding that she only communicates with the Fox Sports broadcaster via the court-monitored app <a href=#>My Family Wizard</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It makes me feel safer because it makes me feel like the verbal abuse will be toned down a little bit more,” King said. “Unfortunately — and shockingly — that’s not always the case, but it does give me a little bit more solace knowing that I have eyes that can be on it.”</p><p>The podcast episode isn’t the first time the former Bravo personality has opened up about her <a href=#>tumultuous relationship</a> with Edmonds and their <a href=#>coparenting struggles</a>. “I don’t know what coparenting is,” she told Us exclusively in February. “I don’t know what it is. Like, I don’t. I’d be the one to get advice. In order to coparent, you have to communicate, right? Yeah, so that would be a good start … Jim hates me. It’s horrible.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGamnZedrq95yqKloGWjnby4v4yrnJqkmanGbrXNrKuan6KWum6uyKSgp6FdpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
