We were just trying to follow God’s lead on everything," the statement read.</p><p>"She didn’t feel that it was the right timing then, so we called it quits for a bit."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But fans in the Duggar discussion group on Reddit believe there may have been a more sinister reason for the split.</p><p>As In Touch Weekly points out, <a href=#>Josiah’s split from Marjorie</a> is once again a frequent topic of conversation on the boards, seemingly as a result of his engagement to Lauren.</p><p>It seems many redditors are convinced that Marjorie – who has published multiple books and has a large following on social media – was interested in Josiah due to his fame and fortune.</p><p>The theorists who fall into this camp propose different ideas about exactly why Josiah and Marjorie called it quits:</p><p>Some believe he got wise to her ulterior motives and called the relationship off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Others feel that she realized he wouldn’t be good for her reputation (due to the <a href=#>Josh Duggar sex scandals</a>) or her bank account (due to the fact that TLC earnings are split many different ways) and decided to seek her fortune elsewhere.</p><p>"It’s a widely spread belief that Marjorie was more into the fame than she was into Josiah, but what if it wasn’t the fame she was after?" wrote one fan.</p><p>"What if she wanted a slice of that sweet, sweet TLC pie, but split as soon as she found out that Josiah would likely never see a cent of it?"</p><p>"’Would you like to enter a courtship?’ ‘Yes, I’d be happy to.’ [side hug] ‘Just letting you know I don’t get any money from the show, Dad takes it all.’ ‘Oh, then I guess I can’t court if you’re broke, it’s over,’" another redditor joked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Still others believe that Marjorie initially hoped to weather the storm of the Josh scandals, but eventually decided an association with the Duggars would do her career more harm than good.</p><p>"She wanted fame and was using Josiah to get it. She was all in until the Josh scandal hit. They lost [19 Kids and Counting] when they began courting. Showed her true colors and its obvious she was a user," one commenter theorized.</p><p>"Hey Marjorie, God is a good score keeper! I didn’t like her, user! Funniest thing yet?</p><p>"She didn’t know there would be another show featuring the older Duggars. She probably hates herself now. She puts on a good show she is happy. But, deep down she cringed."</p><p>Yes, it seems Marjorie has brought Duggar fans and critics together in their shared disdain for her. No easy feat!</p><p><a href=#>Watch Counting On online</a> for more on reality TV’s most controversial family.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Josiah Duggar and Marjorie Jackson: The Courtship That Wasn’t</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WBcLnAq6GoqpmaequtwqSqqKZdrK60edKhnGato567qHnJqKqimZhisbazxpqpZp6fp3qnrcyeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
