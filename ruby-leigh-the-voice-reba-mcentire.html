cover of Patsy Montana's I Want To Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart.</p><p>Although all four judges turned the chair around for her, she chose to be a part of <a href=#>Reba McEntire's team</a>.</p><p>Both the coaches and the viewers have often pointed out Ruby's distinct yodeling abilities as a signature of her singing style.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The

Award</a> winner.</p><p>"Honestly, I thought Reba was my only chance for a chair turn," Ruby recalled.</p><p>She told <a href=# aria-label="KTVI (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KTVI</a>: "Well, 19 seconds into John Legend turns before I even yodeled, and I thought, 'I’m on team Legend' and immediately I was thinking while I was singing, 'Omg, Reba didn’t turn for you and she’s Country...she thinks you’re terrible!'</p><p>"I started yodeling, and she turned, and you can see the relief on my face when she did.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading

turned as well.</p><p>"But when the coaches were pitching themselves to me, I felt like Reba wasn’t really interested in me, and I was leaning really hard towards Niall because he was really pushing for me, and Reba used something that they didn’t disclose on the show."</p><p>Ruby added: "Each coach had a trick they could use only once during the auditions to try to sway a contestant they really wanted, and it was the cardboard hair cutout of Reba’s hair.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

is a huge supporter of me and my music, and I think I would have done very well with him also."</p><p>Since she was nine years old, Ruby has had ambitions for a music career.</p><p>"As soon as I found
