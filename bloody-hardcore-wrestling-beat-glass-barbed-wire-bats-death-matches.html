The barbed wire is very real, the glass is very real, it'll cut you up and scar you up.</p><p>"I'm scarred from head to toe, but those scars are a roadmap, and they tell a lot of great stories."</p><p>Matt, who wrestles anything between one and three matches a week, says you need a high pain threshold to be a hardcore wrestler - and it doesn't hurt if you're a little crazy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/iam_00056677.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/iam_00056711.jpg><p>"Typically, I think a lot of people might say you have to have a screw or two loose to do what we do," Matt added.</p><p>"But some of the nicest people I've known have been death match wrestlers.</p><p>"When they have to perform, that's when they turn the switch on - their pain threshold goes up and their character gets turned up a few notches, and they get to work.</p><p>"After 11 years, the satisfaction I get at this level is being able to make a full-time living, travel and perform. I can provide for my family and take care of my wife and dog.</p><p>"To me, it's just another day at the office, like anyone else doing their 9 to 5 job. It's what I know, it's what I do.</p><p>"You know, some people have to use a frying pan to make an egg for their job, and we have to use barbed-wire bats for ours."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/iam_00060192.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/iam_00056738.jpg><p>And it's not just a men's sport - female hardcore wrestling is "extremely popular", according to Matt, with women even taking on men in the ring and a "huge, growing market" for inter-gender fights.</p><p>Photographer Marc said when it comes to the fans, the bloodier the fight, the better.</p><p>He said one of the most extreme fights he witnessed was a light-tube fight between Matt and fellow wrestler Nick Gage, where both men ended up covered head to toe in blood "like a Tarantino movie" while the audience "went crazy, clapping and applauding".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/iam_00060222.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/iam_00056682.jpg><p>After another brutal match between wrestlers Joey Janela and John Danzig, the fighters took the audience outside the arena, where they climbed to the third storey before plunging into a fiery glass and barbed wire-filled wooden pit.</p><p>"It was insane - they took the audience outside and they climbed on top of a three-storey roof," Marc told Sun Online.</p><p>"Down below was a pickup truck with a wooden square structure in the back, filled with barbed wire and glass on top. Somebody then threw gasoline on it and set it on fire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/iam_00056667.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/iam_00056681.jpg><p>"Then while they were up there, one guy picked the other up and they both fell into this fiery, barbed-wire pickup truck, light-tube explosion.</p><p>"That’s nuts, but it’s also very skilled in the sense they can do this and not die."</p><p>Marc admits he was shocked when he saw his first hardcore match, but soon came to admire the wrestlers' passion for their sport.</p><p>"The first event I ever went to was called the Tournament of Death in Delaware," he said.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in news</h2></p><p>"I was expecting that it may be a little more extreme than WWE wrestling, but all of a sudden, there was barbed wire, people bleeding all over the place, and I was like 'what the f*** am I looking at?'"</p><p>"Once the shock of it had gone away, I started to look at them more like outsider artists - they are really passionate about their performances and they look upon it as a craft or an art form.</p><p>"Watching them afterwards in the locker room they all go through their own matches and talk about how to improve the experience for the audience.</p><p>"It looks simplistic and brutal, but there’s a lot more behind it than that - it’s a very unique subculture."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377540699.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377540698.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377540649.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000377540651.jpg><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
