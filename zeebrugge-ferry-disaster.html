Here's all you need to know...<br></p><h2>What was the Zeebrugge ferry disaster?</h2><p>The Zeebrugge ferry disaster occurred on the night of the 6 March 1987 just after it left the Belgian port.</p><p>The MS Herald of Free Enterprise was making the return journey to Dover from the continent.</p><p>At the time it was one of the fastest ways to get across the English Channel, as construction on the Channel Tunnel would not &nbsp;begin until over a year later.</p><p>The roll-on roll-off vessel was originally found to have capsized as a result of the assistant boatswain falling asleep in his cabin when he should have been closing the door at the bow of the ship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000306865578.jpg><p>However a later inquiry placed a greater level of blame on on his supervisors and the operating company Townsend Thorensen.</p><p>With the door open, sea water immediately flooded the decks and sank the ferry in minutes.<br></p><h2>Were there any survivors?</h2><p>There were more than 500 people aboard the ferry when it went down, meaning, fortunately, it was at less than half its 1,400 capacity.</p><p>More than 150 passengers and almost 40 crew died, meaning the majority of those on board survived the tragedy.</p><p>However it is thought many more would have lost their lives had it not been down to astonishing acts of bravery on the part of crew and passengers.</p><p>Former cop and assistant bank manager Andrew Parker was awarded the George Medal for gallantry after he lay across a broken walkway to allow passengers including his wife and daughter tow walk across his body to safety.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict0003068660901.jpg><p>He survived and became known as "the human bridge" for his act of astonishing bravery.</p><p>Head waiter Michael Skippen was less fortunate receiving the same award posthumously after he perished saving others aboard.</p><p><a href=#>Gillian Lashbrooke was just 16 when she was caught up in the disaster, saying she could remember the terror like it was yesterday.</a></p><p>Gillian only survived because her mother had given her money for a snack, with the young girl having made her way up to the top of the boat to buy food.</p><p><a href=#>Speaking to Good Morning Britain</a>, Gillian said: “I was on the outside of the boat when it capsized, I was at the right railings and I was looking down into the sea and I couldn’t quite believe it… I just thought ‘no this can’t be possibly happening’.”</p><p>She said that while she was in the water, she came across a woman with a child, with the fellow Brit having simply grabbed the little girl and jumped into the sea in an attempt to survive.</p><p>Gillian said: “She told me it wasn’t her child, she told me she just grabbed hold of this little girl and jumped into the sea with her.”</p><p>But the survivors realised that the rescue helicopters couldn’t spot them, with Gillian swimming out to signal for help.</p><p>She said: “I saw a fisherboat and I waved my arms, they came over and pulled me over into the boat.</p><p>“She shouted ‘please Gillian, don’t leave us’.</p><p>“I was able to shout over to her and say they know where you are, stay there and they’re coming for you.</p><p>“But never to his day do I knew what happened to them.”</p><p>After her appearance on GMB someone contacted the programme to say that they thought the little girl sounded like a&nbsp;member of their family, called Lisa Ladybird.</p><p>Then just over two weeks later the pair were reunited in an emotional interview on the programme.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict0003066547861.jpg><h2>What happened afterwards?</h2><p>The MS Herald of Free Enterprise was salvaged by a Dutch company and was re-floated the next month in April 1987.</p><p>There were then attempts to sell the vessel but no buyers were found and it was eventually sent to Taiwan to be scrapped.</p><p>It also resulted in major improvements being made to the safety of these types of ships.</p><p>Watertight ramps were required to be fitted to the bow sections of the ships and "freeing flaps" to allow water to be let out from the car decks in case of flooding were also fitted.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaH1yhZZtb2iylZqvs8HGoJxmnpWnv7p5w6Kqmqukmr9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
