The son of country music producer Jerry Abbott, Abbott started playing guitar at the age of 12, and Pantera released his debut album, Metal Magic, at age 16. Originally a glam metal musician, Abbott was called Diamond Darrell at the time. Two glam metal albums were followed in 1984 and 1985, before original singer Terry Glaze was replaced by Phil Anselmo in 1986 and Power Metal was released. The band's debut album, Cowboys from Hell, introduced the groove metal sound where Abbott's guitar playing was centered. The sound was tweaked on the Vulgar Display of Power, and the band's third record, Far Beyond Driven, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 1994</p><table class=wikibox readability=9.5><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Darrell Lance Abbott, August 20, 1966, Ennis, Texas, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>December 8, 2004, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Cause of death</td><td class=wk_value>Murder (gunshot wounds)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Resting place</td><td class=wk_value>Moore Memorial Gardens, Arlington, Texas</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Other names</td><td class=wk_value>Diamond Darrell (1981–93)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Musician, songwriter</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1981–2004</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Partner(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Rita Haney (1984–2004)</td></tr></table><p>Guitarist Dimebag Darrell was born on August 20, 1966 in Arlington, Texas, United States (He dies at the age of 38, on December 8, 2004).</p><p>A crazed fan assassinated Pantera and Damageplan guitarist who impacted the sound of groove metal.</p><p>All info about Dimebag Darrell can be found here.
