Becky announced the news on social media, where she also shared a few photos from the proposal, in which they were dressed similarly.&nbsp;The couple became romantically involved in 2016 after being introduced by Naomi Scott and appeared in public together on many occasions. Becky characterized Lletget as her closest friend in an interview two months earlier, saying,</p><p>“We’ve been together for almost six years, yet it still seems brand new in many respects because we’re embracing the shifts and changes that are occurring in our lives and inside ourselves, and we’re supporting each other in that. And you can’t truly compel things to happen. However, things have suddenly become quite difficult.”</p><p>Becky said last year that Lletget and her had a lot in common, which deepened their bond even more. She added that their relationship benefited them and created a feeling of mutual love and respect. Becky G told People magazine that Lletget has long liked her work. She also claimed to be a fan of the player, and the two agreed to support one another’s careers while keeping a balance.</p><h2>Sebastian Lletget is a soccer player for FC Dallas.</h2><p>Sebastian Lletget began his career with West Ham United FC in the English Premier League, however, he was never given the opportunity to play on the field.
