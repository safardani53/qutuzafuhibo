All the memories came flooding back when we had our 50th at the end of last year.”</p><p>As a schoolboy, Rofe started playing as a striker before switching to&nbsp;midfield and then full-back, where he spent his entire professional career.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Football">Read More on Football</h2><p>Grammar school-educated, he was spotted by Leyton Orient scouts playing in tournaments in East London — with O’s then manager Jimmy Bloomfield a big influence&nbsp;early on.</p><p>Rofe became a key member in the club’s Third Division triumph in 1969-1970 and the 1971-1972 FA Cup run to the quarter-finals.</p><p>He added: “Jimmy became <a href=#>Leicester</a> manager in 1971.</p><p>“It was a no- brainer for me to rejoin my old boss.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBALL</a></strong></p><p>“I moved to Leicester for a then British&nbsp;record for a defender of £112,000. That lasted just 24 hours because David Nish left&nbsp; Foxes the next day to&nbsp;join Derby for £250,000!”</p><p>“I joined Leicester on the same day Frank Worthington moved to the club from Huddersfield. What an incredible character Frank was — and so dearly missed.</p><p>“We stayed at the Holiday Inn together for the first few months.</p><p>“I always joke that I moved into the Holiday Inn at the age of 22 and by the time I had spent time with Frank,&nbsp;I was 58 when I left the hotel a few months later!</p><p>“I remember Sue and I buying our first house for £12,000 with a mortgage of £8,000. My dad was panicking, asking me how on earth I was going to pay it back.</p><p>“I absolutely loved my time at Leicester. We would go out once a week — if we didn’t have a midweek game — to a working man’s club and play darts and snooker and would put prizes into the raffle to help the proceeds to underpin these places.</p><p>“I was honoured to get my chance to play for the <a href=#>England</a> Under-23s.</p><p>“I played against Czechoslovakia. I still have the England shirt and cap. They are treasured possessions.”</p><h2>ON THE MOVE</h2><p>He switched from Leicester to Chelsea in 1980 after Bloomfield&nbsp;left.</p><p>His three seasons with the Blues were spent in the second tier and by 1982 he was keen to move again.</p><p>He said: “I was living in Aldershot and a neighbour suggested I speak to Lawrie McMenemy at <a href=#>Southampton</a>.</p><p>“I managed to get to talk directly to Lawrie in the oddest way. At the time there was a football agent called Dennis Roach, so when I rang to get through to Lawrie, I was put straight through to him — with them thinking I was the agent.</p><p>“McMenemy was very honest with me. He said he was happy to give me three months to see if it worked out. I spent most of the next 23 years at the club as a player and on the coaching staff.”</p><p>After McMenemy left Saints,&nbsp; Rofe was soon promoted by new manager Chris Nicholl to first-team coaching duties, until the club got rid of them both in 1991.</p><p>Rofe added: “I became manager at Bristol Rovers but the board hadnomoney and&nbsp;it was&nbsp; impossible.”</p><p>He returned to Southampton as youth team coach until 1997 — and had a third stint from 1998 to 2005.</p><p>That left Rofe admitting: “I must be the only person to have been sacked three times there. But I still have a huge soft spot for the place.”</p><p>Incredibly he was appointed by three Saints bosses and survived under SEVEN more.</p><p>Rofe recalled: “I then went on to work for the Football League as a regional manager for its youth development programme. I would oversee the area between Oxford down to Yeovil. I thoroughly enjoyed the role.</p><p>“Then an old mate, Paul Groves,&nbsp;took over at Bournemouth and wanted me to work with him.</p><p>“However, not long after, Paul was replaced by Eddie Howe — a move which proved great for the club.</p><p>“I moved into scouting for clubs like Wolves, Nottingham Forest and Charlton. Then everything changed after the Covid pandemic hit.</p><p>“It completely stopped scouts&nbsp; travelling around the country.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He added: “I maintain a huge&nbsp; passion for the game in a lifetime of playing, coaching and managing. I love watching and being part of matches as much now as when I was playing.</p><p>“Yes I’m 72 and was forced into retirement almost because of the restrictions of Covid but I would still love to be involved in the game. That will never leave me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NINTCHDBPICT000798484205.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9ygZVpampwX6Kur6%2FHnqqtnaJiwq%2B1056bZp%2BVpL%2BosYybnKysXZmyr7rIrGSrp5aafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
