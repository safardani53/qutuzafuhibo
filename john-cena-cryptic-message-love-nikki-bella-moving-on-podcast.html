Get to a point where you love yourself, and you might be surprised at the company you choose to keep,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>WWE star</a> tweeted on April 10. While it’s unclear if John is officially taken or not, he was seen with “company” on March 28. The Blockers&nbsp;star was photographed strolling hand-in-hand with <strong>Shay Shariatzadeh</strong>, a project manager for a tech company in Vancouver, Canada, and both were smiling wide. The intimate outing even prompted a response from John’s ex-fiancée and fellow WWE star, <strong>Nikki Bella</strong>, 35.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“As long as John is happy, I’m happy,” Nikki said on The Bellas Podcast, during its April 10 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>episode</a> — just hours before John took to Twitter to issue his love advice. Nikki then explained she thought she was “unfair to John” after their final breakup in July of 2018, as the end of their romance was filmed for all to see on her reality show,&nbsp;Total Bellas.&nbsp;“Of course it was pro-me, because it was coming through my eyes…Because of how sad I made him and how much I felt like I hurt him, when I saw the big smile on his face with the paparazzi photos [with Shay], I think that’s why I didn’t want to s**t my pants,” she added on Wednesday’s podcast. “I felt happy for him. I am very happy for him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Meanwhile, Nikki has also moved on to her&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars&nbsp;partner, <strong>Artem Chigvintsev</strong> (although they have yet to don official “boyfriend and girlfriend” titles). Although Nikki and John have been spotted with new people, we’ve heard that they were anxious in the days leading up to WrestleMania 35, which took place on April 7. “This weekend will for sure bring up a lot of mixed emotions for both Nikki and John,” an insider EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> before the wrestling showcase. John had “even proposed to Nikki in the wring” at WrestleMania 33 in April 2017, as our source had pointed out.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Instead of trying to find the right person, try to be the right person.

Nikki and John still talk almost daily, and she doesn’t want to offend or upset him. They both truly still care and love one another, and that door still could potentially open up again. “</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH11e5BpZqOnmKN6pLHNmmScqqmlwaqvjKacrKuRnLJuuM6vnGammaC4qnnBnqOlmV2ivLe1zaBkqKZdpbylr8Csq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
