In other words, he found a formula that I truly believe, is the formula to have longevity.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The 14-year NFL vet</a> explained further, “If you did something over and over again, like ran every day, your legs would eventually be filled with lactic acid everyday, so you’ve got to flush them out to get them back to normal. Otherwise, they get tired fatigue, right? Brady basically gets back to zero, every day, by the time he goes to do anything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tony-romo-and-tom-brady-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>How exactly does the 44-year-old, 7-time Super Bowl winner “get back to zero?” “He gets worked on, he activates, elongates, he stretches, makes his body pliable, he eats correctly, he drinks a lot of water while he does everything for inflammation. And then by the end of it, he’s like a sponge,” Romo said. “His body is just never getting balled up tight to where it’s going to break. I think he’s on something that I think the future athletes will be doing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Romo, on the other hand, is onto something that the general public (or every girlfriend, everywhere) will be doing! The commentator partnered with Tostitos to help bring the game of football to&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;with the new ‘Romo earpiece.‘ In the ad-spot, Romo helps out an amateur football fan who is watching the game with his friends, and provides cues on what to say through an earpiece. “The concept itself is so funny,” he said of the partnership. Starting November 4th, football fans and novices will be able to nominate themselves or their clueless friends and family for a chance to win a one-of-a-kind experience with Tony Romo by heading to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tostitos.com/Romo</a>, filling out the necessary information and submitting a quick video submission. The winner will be announced in December and have the opportunity to wow their friends and family members with their overnight football expertise, courtesy of the football legend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FrZq2nnq56s7vMqGStp51ir7Otw7Jkq52knr%2BmucSnq2ahnqmys8LInq5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
