Meet His Sister Abbie</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Edmonton Oilers’ star Nick Bjugstad doesn’t have a brother. He has an older sister named Abbie Bjugstad.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The veteran NHL star, Nick Bjugstad, was making records before even making his debut. Since making his debut in 2013 with Florida Panthers, Bjugstad has played for five different franchises.&nbsp;</p><p>Born and raised in Blaine, Minnesota, by parents Mike and Janeen Bjugstad, Nick grew up with older sister Abbie Bjugstad.</p><p>With a small age gap of two years, the sibling pair get along really well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nick-bjugstad.jpg><p>In the ongoing Stanley Cup playoffs, Nick opened up his scoring against Los Angeles Kings in the pivotal Game 5. This was Nick’s first two-goal game in playoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the other scorers of the night was <a href=# rel=noopener>Zach Hyman</a>, extending the lead to 5-2.</p><p>With the Oilers now one win away from winning the Western Conference first-round playoff, Bjugstad will hope to bring his A-game back on Saturday night.&nbsp;</p><h2>Does Nick Bjugstad Have A Brother?</h2><p>As stated previously, Nick Bjugstad has never mentioned having a brother.&nbsp;</p><p>The former Carolina Panthers center has previously talked about his family members. And during those conversations, nothing gives hints of him having a brother.&nbsp;</p><p>But if he did, we might have had another pair of brothers starring together in the NHL. When talking about brothers in the NHL, Dylan and <a href=# rel=noopener>Ryan Strome</a> are one of the pairs that cross the minds of many fans.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nick-bjugstad-siblings.jpg><p>With his sister, Abbie not having much interest in hockey, Nick was the only one who followed in the footsteps of his dad. His father, Mike Bjugstad, is a former hockey player, having played at UW-Eau Claire.</p><p>One of the other notable family members who played the sport is his uncle, Scott Bjugstad. Scott played for three NHL franchises during the late 80s and early 90s.</p><p>Stories of a pair of athletic brothers are famous in every sport, just like the <a href=# rel=noopener>Kelce brothers</a>. We probably would’ve heard of one more if Nick had a brother.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nick Bjugstad Sister Abbie Bjugstad&nbsp;</h2><p>Nick Bjugstad’s older sister, Abbie Bjugstad, is a product owner at Star Tribune, the largest newspaper in Minnesota.&nbsp;</p><p>Born on August 8, 2020, Abbie previously shared some pictures of her 30th birthday party on <a href=# rel=noopener>Facebook</a>, which featured Nick.</p><p>The older sister of Nick graduated with a degree in Marketing and Communication from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls in 2012.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nick-bjugstad-sister-abbie.jpg><p>After graduation, Abbie worked in several companies. She worked for 6 years in the Netherlands.</p><p>She was the online marketing manager for Sanoma and the Account manager for Advidi, both companies based in the Netherlands.</p><p>Before joining Star Tribune in 2019, Abbie worked as a Strategic Program Manager for Booking.com. It was the job at Star Tribune that brought Abbie back to the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>The bond between Nick and her sister is as clear as a daylight. Abbie sharing several photos of her and Nick’s family vouches for the same.&nbsp;</p><p>She has previously shared photos of her enjoying ice skating with Nick and his wife, Janine, and their daughter, Layla, on her Facebook.&nbsp;</p><h3>Abbie Bjugstad Has Been Involved In Philanthropical Works</h3><p>Even though her Instagram is private, Abbie has linked GoFundMe on her Instagram bio.</p><p>The link takes the page viewers to an article that talks about raising funds for two Nepalese orphans for their educational support.</p><p>The article gives insights into how Abbie came across the kids during her visit to the South Asian country and her plans for the kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abbie-bjugstad.jpg><p>The GoFundMe has already raised the fund above its goal of $1800, but further help would certainly not hurt anybody.</p><p>She has previously shared other posts relating to donations, including the one in 2019, requesting friends to donate to Amazon Conservation Association.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC6yJyiZpqaqrS0wMCdZJuqn6m1pr6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
