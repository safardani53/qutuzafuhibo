Sadly, the 2020 edition of the star-studded extravaganza came less than a month after the tragic death of <strong>Kobe Bryant</strong>. However, instead of letting their sadness consume them, stars like <strong>Quavo, LaRoyce Hawkins, Bad Bunny, Hannibal Buress, Jidenna, Katelyn Ohashi</strong>, <strong>Ronnie 2k</strong> and more used the Feb. 14 event as a way to celebrate Kobe‚Äôs life and legacy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Before the tip-off, there was a tribute to Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, who was killed in a helicopter crash at age 41 on Jan. 26, 2020. Also remembered was former longtime NBA Commissioner <strong>David Stern</strong>, who died&nbsp; at 77 on Jan. 1, 2020 after suffering a brain hemorrhage a few weeks prior. The tribute was to ‚ÄúTwo men who forever changed the NBA and the game of basketball in a way only legends could. They will forever be missed but certainly never forgotten. Thank you David and Kobe. ‚ÄúIn what was supposed to be a moment of silence, fans began chanting ‚Äúkobe, kobe,‚Äù over and over again. During halftime, there was a powerful video montage of Kobe‚Äôs greatest moments at past NBA All-Star games.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Taking place at the Wintrust Arena in Chicago, Illinois, the 2020 All-Star Celebrity game followed the previous years‚Äô tradition of celebrating some hometown heroes. Chicago native <strong>Michael Wilbon</strong> was picked to coach the Home team, playing against <strong>Stephen A. Smith</strong>‚Äôs squad. Team Wilbon consisted of Chicago‚Äôs own <strong>Common</strong> (who was team captain), as well as <strong>Bad Bunny, Hannibal Buress, Kane Brown, Jon Batiste, Alex Moffat, Chef Jos√© Andr√©s, </strong>2019 All-Star Celebrity Game MVP <strong>Famous Los</strong>, <strong>Jidenna, </strong>WNBA star <strong>Chelsa Gray</strong> and NBA legend <strong>Quentin Richardson.</strong> On the opposite end, hometown hero (and the man performing the NBA All-Star Game halftime show) <strong>Chance The Rapper </strong>led Team Stephen A. into battle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Chance was joined by <strong>Quavo, Taylor Bennett, LaYorce Hawkins, Anthony ‚ÄúSpice‚Äù Adams, Marc Lasry, Ronnie 2k, Katelyn Ohashi, Lil Rel Howery, </strong>WNA star <strong>Aja Wilson</strong> and NBA legend <strong>Darius Miles</strong>. Even the coaching staff was packed with star power. Stephen A. had chef <strong>Guy Fieri</strong> as his assistant coach, while Michael Wilbon enlisted Grey‚Äôs Anatomy star <strong>Jesse Williams </strong>as his assistant coach. In the end the final score was Team Wilbon 62, Team Stephan 47, with Common being named MVP for his 10 pounts, 5 rebounds and 5 assists for Team Wilbon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The real winner though was the Special Olympics. The NBA All-Star Game is not just a chance for rappers to feel like ballers, and for your favorite comedians to go one-on-one with Olympians, television stars, and the like. It‚Äôs also a way to raise money for a good cause. This year, Ruffles ‚Äì the Official Chip of the NBA ‚Äì rolled out ‚ÄúTHE RIDGE.‚Äù For the entire game, players shot from the 4-point line. For every shot made from ‚ÄúTHE RIDGE,‚Äù Ruffles would donate $4,000 to the Special Olympics (with a minimum donation of $40,000.)</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Quavo with the block on Common üò≤üî•üí™üèæ.<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#CelebrityGame</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#NBAAllStarWeekend</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/SPYXP7hq0Z</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>‚Äî TimeoutSPORTS__ (@TimeoutSPORTS3) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 15, 2020</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oh no Lil Rel Howery <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@LilRel4</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#NBAAllStarWeekend</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#NBAAllStar</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/vzPenOZ5rr</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>‚Äî MK (@marcusco21) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 15, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>This game kicked off the NBA All-Star Weekend, which has become a Kobe Bryant memorial/celebration in the wake of his tragic death on Jan. 26. Kobe ‚Äì along with his 13-year-old daughter <strong>Gianna</strong> and seven others ‚Äì perished in a helicopter accident in Calabasas, California. Since then, the tributes to the Los Angeles Lakers icon have been nonstop, and the NBA All-Star Game immediately became a way for the game of basketball to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>honor Kobe</a>. The two teams will wear jerseys bearing either number 24 (for Kobe) or number 2 (for Gianna.) The format of the game was also modified to honor Bryant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH1ze5BtZqeakWKurbiMrKuaql2Ysq2xwaugrbFdnK6usYxrZ2toXZ22qLTLop6hrKNisKa4xJuqZqiZmMBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
