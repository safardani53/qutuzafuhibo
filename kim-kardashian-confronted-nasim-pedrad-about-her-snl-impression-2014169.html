I hadn’t slept in two days, I was wearing this extra-large T-shirt with the logo of a medical facility from my hometown. She was understandably mortified to discover that I played her on the show.”</p><p>Usually dressed in a skintight dress and a wig of flowing brunette locks to play Kanye West’s wife, Pedrad cracked audiences up with her nasally impression of the voice of the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and her sisters.</p><p>“She did say — at one point she was like, ‘Do we really sound like that?'” Pedrad said on Conan, putting on her Kardashian voice. “Fair question. She wanted to know!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was like ‘…no,'” she continued, pausing and shaking her head as she decided how to answer the question. “And she just goes, ‘Ohhh, good!’ She was so sweet!”</p><p>Watch Pedrad talk about Kardashian in the video above; plus see her impression of <strong>Aziz Ansari</strong>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3qku82fqaimpJqxbrrArKCmZaCasbOtw2aYm6elqXqpsdFmqqekXZ66sb7ErKqip55if3F9k2ptcmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
