So, what is the water bottle hack that’s sent everyone into a tizzy?

But is this life hack illegal?</h2><p>TikTok users have watched @tripsti’s TikTok <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> more than 7 million times as of this writing. In the clip, T-Rip shows us a little-known loophole. The label on the bottle says: “Return the package for replacement or money back. 1-877-595-2267 or visit us online at Walmart.com."</p><p>Because the text is not very specific, T-Rip says it’s pretty much left up to interpretation. The label doesn’t say return if it’s damaged or tastes bad — it just says bring it back and you’ll get a replacement.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tripsti7 href=#>@tripsti7</a><p>My little life hack I thought I'd share with y'all! <a title=freewater href=#>#freewater</a> <a title=walmart href=#>#walmart</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - T-Rip" href=#>♬ original sound - T-Rip</a></figure><p>For @tripsti7, that means saving all of his empty water bottles and the package they came in to take back up to Walmart for a fresh set.</p><p>But before you start stocking up on 36-packs, you should keep in mind that what you’re doing may or may not be illegal.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>This isn’t the first time someone has taken to the internet with this hack. The poignant discussion about sipping and dipping even made its way to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@tripsti7</a></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p>Additionally, a few people actually did the research to get to the bottom of this whole water bottle debacle. Come to find out, T-Rip’s assertion wasn’t entirely correct.</p><p>This life hack isn’t technically illegal, but it’s not entirely ethical either. <a href=#>Walmart’s policy</a> doesn’t necessarily state that you can drink water free of charge just because you brought the empty bottles back to the store.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@tripsti7</a></figure><p>“I just looked it up. And it didn't give me any information so I called the help number,” one commenter wrote on the Reddit thread.</p><p>“And I got told by the employee no you will not get a refund or replace that unless the water [tastes] bad. They don't have a recycling program or anything like that,” their comment continued.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>“And when you do a return, they likely take down your ID, and habitual returners will eventually get [a] notification that they will no longer be allowed returns,” another user added, and they make a pretty good point.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@tripsti7</a></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p>A user named Dylan wrote under tripsti7’s tutorial: “I've done this with something else, I forget what. The key is being nice. If they think you're just exploiting a loophole, they'll turn you away.”</p><p>Given that a pack of water from Walmart only costs a couple of dollars, it’s best you only use this life hack for a very rainy day. After all, it’s probably better you’d stay safe than be sorry!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7%2BmsYywmK2domKzs7vMZq6apJ2Wv7V5x5qapA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
