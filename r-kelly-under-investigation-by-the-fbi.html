Kelly has been dropped by Sony</a>. It was long overdue, but very welcome.</p><p>There’s more good news: the chilling Surviving R. Kelly docuseries attracted more than just nationwide attention.</p><p>The FBI itself is looking into Kelly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/r-kelly-sings-770x1024.jpg><p><a href=#>TMZ</a> reports that the FBI has been in contact with Timothy, the father of Jocelyn Savage.</p><p>An FBI special agent has spoken to Timothy at least 5 times over the course of the past year and a half.</p><p>The most recent contact, TMZ reports, was just weeks before Surviving R. Kelly began airing on Lifetime on January 3.</p><p>According to TMZ: “Timothy provided the FBI with all the known whereabouts of Kelly and Joycelyn from state to state.”</p><p>“Starting with where their relationship began,” TMZ reports. “Along with text messages or emails.”</p><p>That state-to-state business is relevant.</p><p>When you take a minor across state lines for purposes of sex, that falls under the jurisdiction of the FBI.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/r-kelly-without-glasses-972x1024.jpg><p>The report continues, revealing the nature of what Timothy told the FBI.</p><p>Much of the information was similar to what he revealed on the Surviving R. Kelly docuseries.</p><p>That means allegations of predatory behavior and sexual abuse.</p><p>(Presumably with more specifics, like times and dates, which tend to be useful to investigators)</p><p>To be clear, TMZ notes that it’s unclear if these questions are part of a larger criminal investigation into R. Kelly.</p><p>(The FBI neither confirms nor denies investigations, which is a pretty good policy)</p><p>That said, the disgraced R&B singer is already under criminal investigation in Georgia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/r-kelly-smoking-593x1024.png><p>Jocelyn Savage’s family believes that R. Kelly is holding her against her will.</p><p>Jocelyn herself has strongly denied this.</p><p>That is not actually surprising.</p><p>We have all read and listened to the harrowing testimony who describe having escaped from Kelly’s alleged abusive sex cult.</p><p>The allegations include using tactics such as physical violence and starvation — and grooming — to control people.</p><p>Potentially, SWAT teams could raid a compound and ask a woman if she needs help, and she could very well say “no.”</p><p>No warrant can break through a psychological prison.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/r-kelly-sucks-754x1024.jpg><p>This is a problem that the FBI has encountered before.</p><p>Unfortunately, this sometimes leaves the hands of law enforcement tied.</p><p>Other documentaries have spoken about the Church of Scientology and federal agencies considering raiding remote locations to free suspected captives.</p><p>Scientology survivors have warned that such people would not consider themselves prisoners and would refuse outside assistance.</p><p>Brainwashing is not an indictment of the victim, but upon the perpetrator.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/r-kelly-image-684x1024.jpg><p>R. Kelly has repeatedly blasted the allegations against him, both by families and by survivors themselves.</p><p>He has even insinuated that this is all some sort of racist conspiracy against him, because he is a successful black man.</p><p>There have, unfortunately, been conspiracies to sabotage black men in the past. This is not one of them.</p><p>If anything, racism has allowed R. Kelly to operate unchecked for longer than it might have otherwise.</p><p>His accusers are all black women or the families of black women.</p><p>Imagne if a bunch of families held up photos of their beautiful young&nbsp;white daughters and described these allegations.</p><p>R. Kelly might have been put out of business years ago.</p><p>It is not racist to demand that R. Kelly face justice.</p><p>It is not homophobic to want to see Bryan Singer out of a job and behind bars for his alleged sexual predation upon teens.</p><p>The fact that both of these men have alleged otherwise is almost as chilling as the allegations against them.</p><p>Very real bigotries should never be used as a shield to protect alleged monsters.</p><p>We don’t know how Jocelyn Savage can be saved by any outside force.</p><p>In our legal system, she may have to make a run for it herself.</p><p>When she does, we should all listen to her story, not ask why she did not make her escape sooner.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>R.
