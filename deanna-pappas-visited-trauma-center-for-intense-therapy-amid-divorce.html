So, to split them up now and only have them part of the week and then they are with Stephen that’s all really hard stuff, that’s trauma. So I did a lot of therapy in the last couple of years, in particular <a href=#>trauma therapy</a>.”</p><p class=p1>Pappas — who <a href=#>announced her divorce from Stagliano, 39,</a> earlier this year — further revealed that a visit to a “trauma center” helped her navigate her complicated emotions.</p><p>“I <a href=#>went to a trauma center</a> back in December and I went three days a week for three hours — intensive therapy,” Pappas told Robertson, 40. “[It was] the best thing I could have done for myself. I found it astounding and life-changing. If I could have afforded to go for another month, I would have because I found it astounding and the things that I learned about myself and my marriage.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DeAnna-Pappas-Went-to-a-%E2%80%98Trauma-Center-for-%E2%80%98Intensive-Therapy-Amid-Stephen-Stagliano-Divorce3.jpg><p class=p1>One month after visiting the California-based facility, Pappas and Stagliano<a href=#> released a joint Instagram statement</a> to confirm their divorce plans after nearly 12 years of marriage.</p><p class=p1>“I have rode every wave of grief that could possibly be ridden and Stephen and I, when we posted back in January [the] statement that we were going to be separated and [were] getting a divorce, we talked about that and we made that statement together,” she said on Wednesday. “I also didn’t do it until I was ready to do it, like, we had been separated for six months before then. … We’d had a tough couple of years, we’ve had a really difficult time. Marriage is work and are successful when you can learn to grow together and have great communication.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Pappas — who shares <a href=#>kids Addison, 9, and Austin, 7,</a> with Stagliano — explained that the twosome struggled to communicate when they were together. Her trauma center visit also helped her learn new communication skills moving forward.</p><p class=p1>While the estranged couple navigates their post-divorce new normal, Pappas <a href=#>has not started dating again</a> — and told Robertson that she cannot see herself “ever getting married again.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZGju6J5z5qnqZmjYsOqv8itnJ1lpKeutrnAZpqepqSav26yzqtkoqakmru0sYytn56qkaXGbq3MoptmnJmrvLOvxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
