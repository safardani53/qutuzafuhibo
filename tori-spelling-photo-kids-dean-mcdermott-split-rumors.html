Neither of them can afford&nbsp;to go through divorce proceedings.”&nbsp;</p><p>Their financial burden is significant, as the insider noted: “They have five kids and a ton of pets," and added on top of the expenses "their home is always a disaster- it's just a total mess.”&nbsp;</p><p>The source added: “Right now divorce isn't on the horizon because they can't swing&nbsp;it financially. They are in a living nightmare.”&nbsp;</p><p>Another insider previously&nbsp;told The Sun that when Dean was working on projects in Canada recently, he was "happy to be going away and he was ready to be done with his marriage when he returned.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When Dean got back from his trip he was greeted with “bills that had piled up. And a lot of those bills are in part because they have so many pets.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The source added that not only are the pets expensive, but they create “a huge&nbsp;mess.&nbsp;It’s just another thing they fight about.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>'THEY DON'T SHARE A BEDROOM'</strong></h2><p>Not only are&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tori and Dean constantly fighting</a>, but they also aren’t sleeping together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The insider added: “They don’t share a bedroom. They are sort of stuck. He financially can’t afford to really move out right now."</p><p>Tori touched on their sleeping situation in a June radio interview on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SiriusXM Radio Andy&nbsp;Jeff Lewis Live</a>.</p><p>Jeff asked&nbsp;Tori: "There's speculation that there's problems at home, but there's no problems at home... What is really going on. You put the wedding ring on. Are things okay?</p><p>"Because I feel like the last time you were here things were good, you were having sex. Are you guys sleeping in the same bed? Personal?"</p><p>Tori responded:&nbsp;"You know what. Right now my kids and dogs sleep in my bed."</p><h2><strong>SEPARATE ROOMS</strong></h2><p>When Jeff continued to prod asking if Dean was sleeping in the guest room, Tori answered: "He's in a room."</p><p>She divulged:&nbsp;"Since he left, this is not good you guys. But since he left, he was gone for six months filming in another country. They all stayed with me.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"So I currently still have four in the bedroom with me who have yet to go back to their rooms. Yes... They have beds in there, and two sleep in bed with me. And Pets. Three dogs.</p><p>Jeff replied: "Wow. Okay. That sounds healthy. Yeah.
