After a video of her lip syncing <a href=#>"Soph Aspin Send" by Millie B.</a> went viral, Bella took her social media star power and embarked on a music career.</p><p>Now, the Navy veteran's debut single, "Build a B---h," is a radio staple, and its accompanying music video has nearly 250 million views on YouTube. She's showing no signs of slowing down in her bustling career.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though her professional achievements speak for themselves, fans are still wondering about Bella's personal life. Her song is all about shutting down the unattainable standards that men often have for women, and she appears to be enjoying the single life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Bella Poarch have a boyfriend?</h2><p>The TikTok sensation doesn't discuss her dating life often, and she last publicly confirmed that she was single in July 2021. In a TikTok video, Bella shared that she was looking for her soulmate at a Seafood City supermarket.</p><p>While appearing on an episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The H3 Podcast</a> about a month earlier, Bella said that she had been single for about a year. She opened up about her past relationships, and about how she had to shift her dating expectations when she moved from the Philippines to the United States.</p><p>"I only had two ex-boyfriends," Bella said about her second ex, who was in the military at the same time as her. She noted that the two broke up because she decided to leave the Navy.</p><p>The names of Bella's exes have not been publicly shared, and other information is not known about them.</p><p>Though Bella herself hasn't shared many details about her past dating history, she's still been linked to one famous face in particular. In the fall of 2020, Bella and rapper Tyga began posting videos together online.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unsurprisingly, fans soon began speculating about whether the two were romantic or not. A rumor circulated that there was an intimate video of the artists going around online, but that was never corroborated.</p><p>Neither Bella nor Kylie Jenner's ex discussed whether things were more than platonic. The musicians have not posted content together in quite some time. Because Bella said that she had been single for about a year in the summer of 2021, it doesn't seem as if she ever formally dated Tyga.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Bella did suggest that she would join Tinder in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video posted for Flighthouse </a>in early 2021, the influencer has since stated that she wants to meet someone in the flesh.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bella confirmed that there are "a lot of guys" in her DMs, but she wants to meet someone in person.</h2><p>During her appearance on The H3 Podcast, the Warner Records artist did say that she's getting a lot of attention in her direct messages on social media. But, that's not exactly the way to her heart.</p><p>"There's a lot of guys in my DMs," Bella said. "I mean, I gotta meet the person... I don't like the thought of DMing someone, or responding to DMS. I want to meet them at a party..."</p><p>As she sang in her debut song, the social media personality certainly isn't looking for "Prince Charming" anyway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KtuMBmp6iZopi1bq7Osp2roZWjsW64yKyr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
