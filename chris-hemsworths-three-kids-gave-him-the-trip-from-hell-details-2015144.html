"It was kind of like the trip from hell."</p><p class=p1>A Melbourne native, Hemsworth is raising three children with model and actress Pataky, 38, whom he married in 2010. The Spanish beauty gave birth to the couple's first child, daughter<strong> India</strong> in May 2012, and welcomed twin boys <strong>Tristan</strong> and <strong>Sasha</strong> in March of last year.&nbsp;</p><p class=p1>"They were all sick and literally took turns to scream," the Thor star continued to host <strong><a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a></strong> of his brood. "One would kinda do it and then look over and be like, 'I'm done, you want a turn?' 'Yep, Wahhhh!' The whole cabin, yeah, wanted to kick us off… I don't know what people expect though — you're gonna put them in the suitcase or something?"</p><p class=p1>When she isn't ill and screaming on airplanes, Hemsworth's daughter is quite the impressive child. Approaching her 3rd birthday, the little girl was raised bilingual by her Madrid-born mother and English-speaking father.&nbsp;</p><p class=p1>"My daughter is bilingual," <strong><a href=#>Liam Hemsworth</a></strong>'s brother began. "Amazing, like, you walk in the room and if someone's not authentically Spanish, she just won't even have it. She's like, 'Nah,' and goes back to English. Even if my mom or someone even attempts to speak in Spanish, she's like, 'That's horrible. You're butchering the language. Get out.'"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Hemsworth added that the discerning young girl speaks Spanish with an Australian accent that she inherited from him. He went on to do an impresson of his daughter repeating "Como estas, mate?"</p><p class=p1>Watch Hemsworth dish on his kids in the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacoKKewG60xKaqsKeiqbW0edOhqZ6dXaC2pb%2BMoJivnV2dtq5506GcZqyinr1ustGopGaglaG5brDErZiipKNif3F9lGprbWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
