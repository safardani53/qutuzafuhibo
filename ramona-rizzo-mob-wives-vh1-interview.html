The only person I’m willing to speak about is my grandfather. We’re the real deal.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ramona’s grandfather <strong>Benjamin Ruggiero</strong> was a “soldier” in the Bonanno crime family.

I grew up differently. The word ‘mob’ was never used in my home. …&nbsp;I saw all the news with my&nbsp;grandfather, and that’s how she found her family’s secret out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>After watching what happened to her family when her grandfather went to prison, Ramona decided she wanted to break away from the lifestyle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Everything I went through, I didn’t want to marry Italian,” Ramona explains. “If [I had] a boy, he could possibly be in the lifestyle.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Sadly, Ramona’s marriage of 10 years turned out to bring its own hardships. The man she married was of Arab descent and ended with her struggling to get a divorce and fighting to get her kids out of the country of Jordan.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“The last time I was in Jordan was to get divorced,” she says. “I went there for two-and-a-half years.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Ramona now raises her four children — <strong>Giovanni</strong> 13, <strong>Anissa</strong>, 12, <strong>Melina</strong>, 11, <strong>Gianna</strong> 7 — on her own in the United States.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>So far on Mob Wives, Ramona has come to be known as the ally and friend of Karen.
