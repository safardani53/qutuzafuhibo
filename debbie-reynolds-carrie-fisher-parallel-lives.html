After winning a beauty contest in 1948, two talent scouts from MGM and Warner Bros. approached Reynolds with contracts — a coin flip landed in favor of the latter, marking the beginning of an enduring showbiz career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Texas Monthly</a>, after being crowned Miss Burbank and signing with Warner Bros., studio head Jack Warner thought to give her the stage name Debbie because it was "a cute name for a little girl" — and the rest, as they say, was history.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reynolds' rise to stardom came quickly throughout the '50s with starring roles in films like&nbsp;Singin' in the Rain&nbsp;(1952),&nbsp;Bundle of Joy&nbsp;(1956) and&nbsp;Tammy and the Bachelor&nbsp;(1957), which earned her continued success as one of the darlings of Hollywood's golden age.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amid her budding career, Reynolds welcomed her first baby, daughter&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Carrie Fisher</a>, with her then-husband and entertainer, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Eddie Fisher</a>, on Oct. 21, 1956. Considering her parentage, Carrie inheriting a passion for performing seemed written in the stars.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following her mother's footsteps, Carrie landed her first movie gig as a teenager in 1975's&nbsp;Shampoo. Like Reynolds, Carrie, too, achieved an early career break by landing a role in the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Star Wars</a>&nbsp;trilogy as Princess Leia, a character whose cultural impact not only made Carrie a household name on Earth but in a galaxy far, far away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, an indelible Hollywood legacy isn't all the mother and daughter share in common. Both endured difficult marriages and financial and personal hardships that often shook — but never shattered — their loving bond. So when Carrie and Reynolds died just one day apart in December 2016, it left an unfillable void in their wake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From their signature movies to their troubled marriages, the mother-daughter duo's careers were filled with more coincidences than none.

As a contestant in the Miss Burbank beauty pageant when she was 16, a talent scout from Warner Bros. discovered her and signed her to a contract with the powerhouse studio.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She made five films in three years with luminaries like Lana Turner and Fred Astaire — but her sixth,&nbsp;Singin' in the Rain,&nbsp;turned Reynolds from just another ingénue into America's Sweetheart. She was 19.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Growing up the daughter of Reynolds and singer and actor Eddie, Carrie was surrounded by the illustrious world of film, theater and television. Despite ensemble roles in Broadway's&nbsp;Irene&nbsp;(alongside Reynolds) and a film debut in the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Warren Beatty</a>-led&nbsp;Shampoo, she didn't have her breakout gig until landing a part in the 1977 sci-fi action film&nbsp;Star Wars.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie held her own&nbsp;auditioning for the movie at 19&nbsp;alongside future costar and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>off-screen love interest</a>&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Harrison Ford</a>.

Neither did&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kathy Selden</a>, Reynolds' chorus girl-turned-movie star in&nbsp;Singin' in the Rain. These were two strong, independent female characters who had ownership over their lives — mold-breaking themes at the time for their respective film genres.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They were just two roles in a long line of strong women the actresses portrayed on-screen. There was her turn in 1989's&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>When Harry Met Sally</a>, where she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>played Marie</a>, the best friend of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Meg Ryan</a>'s Sally Albright, who felt no social shame being a single New Yorker dating a married man. Then there was Carrie's soap opera casting agent Betsy Faye Sharon in 1991's&nbsp;Soapdish,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>a self-proclaimed "bitch</a>" who had no problem bossing around her male actors (and, occasionally, sleeping with them).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Reynolds, one can look no further than 1964's&nbsp;The Unsinkable Molly Brown.&nbsp;As the titular character — a no-nonsense, tough-as-nails survivor of the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sinking of the Titanic in 1912</a>&nbsp;— Reynolds embodied Brown's "unsinkable" spirit. Big, brassy and bold, she pushed through every obstacle in her path to get her happy ending. The part earned Reynolds an&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Academy Award</a>&nbsp;nomination for Best Actress and generations of female admirers who would not be afraid to speak their minds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-both-were-animated-personalities></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Both were animated personalities</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to their live-action roles, the mother-daughter acting duo regularly worked on animated projects — both voicing characters on Fox's&nbsp;Family Guy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reynolds began her voice-over career with the 1973 animated adaptation of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>E.B. White's classic tale</a>&nbsp;Charlotte’s Web, voicing Charlotte, the loving spider who helps a pig named Wilbur discover his confidence.

The couple was best friends with another A-list celebrity duo:&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Elizabeth Taylor</a>&nbsp;and Mike Todd. After Todd died in a 1958 plane crash, Eddie and Taylor became an item, leading to his widely publicized divorce from Reynolds in 1959 and subsequent marriage to Taylor that same year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1960, Reynolds married businessman Harry Karl. They were both worth millions at the time, but Karl was a notorious gambler who lost all of his money — and hers too. After 13 years together, the couple divorced in 1973, leaving Reynolds broke.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was very difficult," Reynolds said on&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Oprah Winfrey</a>&nbsp;Show&nbsp;in 2011. "Everything went — homes and everything. Every bill he had — he owed $10 million — so then I got to pay that off. Everything was taken by the government."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She joked, "I had such good taste in men."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie's love life wasn't much better. She had an explosive love affair with singer&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Paul Simon</a>, whom she wed in 1983 and divorced a year later. They continued to date, on and off, for about a decade before&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>ending their relationship</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the biography&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Homeward Bound: The Life of Paul Simon</a>, author Peter Ames Carlin described their tumultuous relationship as a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>mix of love and personal crises</a>&nbsp;stemming from their swinging states of depression, Carrie's drug use and an array of personal insecurities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After splitting for good, Carrie went on to have a relationship with talent agent&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bryan Lourd</a>. Though they never married and separated once Lourd came out as gay, they had one child together: actress&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Billie Lourd</a>.

Whether it was their divorces, the perils of dating, aging in Hollywood or their own relationship, both were&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>outspoken and unfiltered in interviews</a>&nbsp;throughout their careers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie was an especially passionate mental health advocate after being&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>diagnosed with bipolar disorder</a>&nbsp;in her late 20s. Managing her mental illness with medication and electroconvulsive therapy, she often wrote about her treatment and the lessons she learned by embracing the disorder. In an inspiring letter written for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Guardian</a>&nbsp;in November 2016, just weeks before her death, Fisher showed how fearless she was in&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>sharing her experience with the bipolar community</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was told that I was bipolar when I was 24 but was unable to accept that diagnosis until I was 28 when I overdosed and finally got sober," she wrote in response to a bipolar writer named Alex, who sought Carrie's guidance on navigating life with the disease. "Only then was I able to see nothing else could explain away my behavior."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The mother and daughter also listened to each other — and learned from their mistakes. As Reynolds explained to Winfrey in their joint interview in 2011, witnessing Carrie manage her bipolar disorder helped make her more resilient.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am a strong person," Reynolds said. "I'm not afraid of almost anything, and that's a lot because of [Carrie's] example."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-both-were-loving-mothers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Both were loving mothers</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dove/Evening Standard/Getty; Kevin Winter/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though they loved each other until the end, Reynolds and Carrie had&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a somewhat complicated bond</a>&nbsp;— most memorably documented in&nbsp;Postcards from the Edge, the 1990 movie based on Carrie's 1987&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>semi-autobiographical novel</a>&nbsp;of the same name.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Desperately seeking her own identity from the shadow of her mother's fame, Carrie became estranged from Reynolds. The two barely spoke for almost 10 years.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We had a fairly volatile relationship earlier on in my 20s," Carrie said on&nbsp;The Oprah Winfrey Show. "I didn’t want to be around her. I did not want to be Debbie Reynolds' daughter."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reynolds added, "It's very hard when your child doesn't want to talk to you, and you want to talk to them, and you want to touch them, you want to hold them. It was a total estrangement. She didn't talk to me for probably 10 years. So that was the most difficult time of all. Very painful, very heartbreaking."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ultimately, time began to heal their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It took like 30 years for Carrie to be really happy with me,” Reynolds told PEOPLE in 1988.
