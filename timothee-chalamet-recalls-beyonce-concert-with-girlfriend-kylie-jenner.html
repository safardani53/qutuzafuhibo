However, the Wonka star, 27, recently recalled the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a> concert he attended in September with the <i>Kardashians</i> star — where they were spotted sharing a kiss in the audience.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While speaking with MTV’s <b>Josh Horowitz </b>in a recent video <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview</a>, Timothée noted he had fun at the pop star’s <i>Renaissance World Tour</i> show, even though he isn’t a die-hard fan.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“That was great,” he said. “I was actually surprised. I’m not, like, Beyhive-level, but I thought I knew way more [songs]. But I guess I know some of the more basic hits. She didn’t do ‘Halo.’ She didn’t do ‘Single Ladies.’ … I do love ‘Halo’ though. ‘Halo’ is a great moody 12-year-old head-against-the-bus song.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kylie-timothee-chalamet-us-open-embed-2.jpg alt="Kylie Jenner TImothee Chalamet" width=600 height=700 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The concert wasn’t the first time when the <i>Don’t Look Up</i> actor and the makeup mogul, 26, were spotted in public together, but social media clips quickly went viral of them sharing a brief kiss and embracing at the show. That same month, the pair were seen attending the U.S. Open together.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kylie sparked rumors that she was dating Timothée earlier this year. Though they managed to keep things under the radar for a while, multiple outlets reported in April that they were, in fact, dating. <i>Us Weekly </i>reported over the summer that the duo had “been spending much more time together, and they’re growing much closer as the days go by.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The Kardashian-Jenner family was happy to see Kylie find a new love interest since splitting from ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Travis Scott</b></a>, whom she shares her kids, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stormi and Aire</a>, with.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Some of Kylie’s family members have met Timothée, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Kris</b> [<b>Jenner</b>]</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Kendall</b> [<b>Jenner</b>]</a>,” a source told the outlet. “They really like him and think he’s different from anybody Kylie has dated in the past. He has a great sense of humor, and he makes her smile which is the most important thing to them. They love seeing how happy she is and absolutely approve of them dating.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Since the <i>Lady Bird </i>actor and the reality TV personality have chosen to play it coy when it comes to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their relationship</a>, Kylie made sure to avoid mentioning her boyfriend by name in an interview with<i> WSJ. Magazine</i> in October. While opening up about her love of sci-fi films, she gave Timothée a subtle nod by complimenting his movie <i>Dune</i> by saying, “I do love that movie.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5FpZq2hnaTBqbHEZpqhmZyWuqbAjKucnJmcocBursSypqeblWKwsLrCnqmtZaeewal5xqKppZ6inrKvsIyksKWhlWK3prrNnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
