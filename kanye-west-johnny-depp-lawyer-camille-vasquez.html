A source close to the situation explained that Kanye was also wasn’t able to come to an agreement with the Brown Rudnick law firm, to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Post</a>.&nbsp;“After Ye doubled down this weekend, Camille dropped him. The firm still wanted to make it work but on the condition he retract, he wouldn’t — so he fired them,” they told the outlet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Camille and the law firm are from the only ones to cut ties to Kanye. Talent agency CAA, who represented Kanye for touring, announced they were dropping him on Monday, October 24. He also had a documentary by MRC shelved, per <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. Fashion house Balenciaga announced that they were severing ties from him in a statement from their parent company on Friday to Women’s Wear Daily.&nbsp;“Balenciaga has no longer any relationship nor any plans for future projects related to this artist,” they said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Fashion magazine&nbsp;Vogue&nbsp;announced that neither it nor its editor-in-chief&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Anna Wintour</a>&nbsp;</strong>have any intentions to work with the rapper following his anti-semitic remarks in a statement to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>.

The outlet says that sources close to Kanye, 45, have told them that he hired Camille along with her firm Brown Rudnick. The news comes as the rapper faces much scrutiny following a series of antisemitic remarks on social media and in interviews.&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>has reached out to the legal team for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kanye-west-Camille-Vasquez-hired-lawyer-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kanye hired Camille to be part of a group of attorneys to represent his businesses, including work related to contracts and deals. Prior to the story about his new lawyer breaking, fashion brand Balenciaga announced that it was ending its connections to Ye. “Balenciaga has no longer any relationship nor any plans for future projects related to this artist,” the brand’s parent company Kering said in a statement to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Women’s Wear Daily</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Aside from being dropped by Balenciaga, the news comes following a series of outbursts from&nbsp;The Life of Pablo&nbsp;rapper, seemingly beginning with the rapper debuting a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“White Lives Matter”</a> shirt at a Paris Fashion Week show. A number of people called out Kanye including the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black Lives Matter organization</a>. Kanye then shared an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>antisemitic remark</a> that he’d sent to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Diddy</a>&nbsp;</strong>on Instagram, which led to him being restricted on the social media platform. He doubled down by tweeting that he was going “death [sic] con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,” which led to him being<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> kicked off of Twitter as well</a>. Additionally, he’s also falsely claimed that&nbsp;<strong>George Floyd’s&nbsp;</strong>death was the result of a fentanyl overdose, not murder, during an interview on the Drink Champs podcast. This has led to Floyd’s family<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> filing a $250 million lawsuit</a> against the rapper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kanye-west-Camille-Vasquez-hired-lawyer-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Camille should be easily recognizable to fans who watched Johnny Depp’s defamation trial against his ex-wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Amber Heard,</a>&nbsp;</strong>which ended with the&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean&nbsp;star being awarded <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>$10 million in damages</a>. Camille passionately <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made the case</a> to try to discredit Amber, 36, which led to Johnny’s victory. Amid the trial, she became one of the standouts, with many fans wondering if she and Johnny, 58, had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>secretly started dating</a>. These rumors were quickly put to rest because <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she has a boyfriend</a>. She’s also called out the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>speculation as “sexist</a>,” while also pointing out that it’s “unethical to date clients. “It’s unfortunate and it’s disappointing, but at the same time it kind of comes with the territory. I can’t say I was all that surprised,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People </a>in an interview.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FtZqSZnq6ybsPErKtmop%2Bdu6%2FFjJ2cqahdoa64xcSrZJyZnZ65rbGMr5isqaWax3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
