Kathryn had romantic relationships with several men, including a few of her co-stars, when she was on the show for the first eight seasons.

Her stormy relationship with her co-star <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Thomas Ravenel</strong></a>, with whom she shares two children, was chronicled on the show. Kathryn will be missed on&nbsp;Southern Charm — but she won’t be forgotten. And neither will all her past relationships. Here’s everything you need to know about Kathryn’s dating history.</p><h2>Whitney Sudler-Smith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kathryn-Dennis-boyfriend-history-Whitney-Sudler-Smith-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kathryn secretly hooked up with&nbsp;Southern Charm&nbsp;creator, producer and star&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Whitney Sudler-Smith</a>&nbsp;</strong>during season 1, before she started dating Thomas. Years later, Kathryn and Whitney hooked up again, before the start of season 6 in 2019. Kathryn talked the first time she hooked up with Whitney on the show during season 6.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“The first time Whitney and I hooked up he said ‘Don’t tell anyone,’ and I was really intimidated by him at the time so I was like, ‘Okay, I really, really won’t,’ ”she told her co-stars during an episode. “But at the end of the day, he’s the one that ended up telling everyone. I even lied to Thomas and at that point I was idiotically in love with him.” Whitney would not admit to the&nbsp;Southern Charm&nbsp;cast that he hooked up with Kathryn.</p><h2>Thomas Ravenel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kathryn-Dennis-boyfriend-history-Thomas-Ravenel-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kathryn and Thomas, 61, had a turbulent relationship that began on the first season of the show. They met when Kathryn was a 21-year-old college student. Despite their 30-year age gap, Kathryn and Thomas dated for the first few seasons of the show, and Kathryn ended up getting pregnant. Their daughter <strong>Kensie</strong>&nbsp;was born in March 2014. Thomas and Kathryn broke up but reunited and conceived son, <strong>Saint</strong>, who was born in 2015.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>After their brief reconciliation, Kathryn and Thomas split for good in 2016 and faced off in a years-long <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>custody battle</a> that is still going on. Thomas left Southern Charm&nbsp;after season 5 after he was accused of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sexual assault</a> by two women, including his kids’ former nanny. He pled guilty to third-degree assault and battery and paid $500 fine and donated $80,000 to a sexual assault survivors’ charity, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>. Kathryn and Thomas have <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reunited several times</a> since their split for their children, but they’ve made it clear they aren’t getting back together.</p><h2>Shep Rose</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kathryn-Dennis-boyfriend-history-shep-rose-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kathryn and her co-star&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shep Rose</strong></a> hooked up a few times during her run on the show. Kathryn addressed their brief fling on an episode of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Watch What Happens Live</a>&nbsp;in 2019. “I will say life would be a lot different if I would have pursued him. But I don’t really think I have a one that got away,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Shep talked about his relationship with Kathryn in his 2021 memoir, Average Expectations. “I had a wonderful time with Kathryn during our brief affair,” Shep wrote in his book, per&nbsp;US Weekly. “I also remember tearing each other’s clothes off … Oh wait, I said I won’t reveal too much,” he added. “She was lovely and I do believe I had a calming influence on her and maybe still do.”</p><h2>Joseph Abruzzo</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@SenatorAbruzzo</a> and Chief of Staff & Chief Deputy Clerk Shannon Ramsey-Chessman congratulated Director of Strategic Management and Professional Development Nicole Gasparri on her new role as Secretary/Treasurer for the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@floridaGFOA</a>.

She revealed why they broke up on <a href=# data-once=mparticle-click-element rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Dish podcast</a> in June 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“We just met whenever my friends had met him; I didn’t know him well enough to pick up on patterns to then make a decision whether or not to move forward,” the reality star said. “Whenever I noticed <strong>Danni</strong> [<strong>Baird</strong>] being upset with me because she didn’t agree with the way he talked to me or things he did, that’s when I started to think, hm, if my friends are turning on me, I do not need this man in my life. Girls are more important than any kind of dude,” Kathryn added.</p><h2>Hunter Price</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Kathryn was in a relationship with country singer and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>America’s Got Talent </a>contestant&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hunter Price</strong></a> for less than a year. Their split made the news in August 2019 the day after season 6 finished airing. “Kathryn is not engaged to anyone but herself. She and Hunter actually split about two weeks ago,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “Their relationship ran its course. Kathryn is doing well, and staying focused on the kids.”</p><h2>Chleb Ravenell</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Kathryn’s last-known relationship was with her co-star <strong>Chleb Ravenell</strong>, who joined the show as a main cast member in season 8. Their recurring miscommunication led to their breakup during the July 8, 2022 episode. Chleb <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spoke to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong></a> after the split and revealed that he and Kathryn don’t talk anymore.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“I’ll be honest with you, we don’t really talk right now,” Chleb said. “I wouldn’t say we ended on really bad terms, but we just went our separate ways. Right now, I just hope she learned from our relationship, and she can bring the good from our relationship into her next relationship. I hope I can do the same. I mean, that’s really the only thing I can really say right now.” He also said part of the reason for their breakup was that they “grew up differently and had different backgrounds.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8qaq6GqqaN6pbHNp6CsZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWVlZoF6fI9xZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
