What does that have to do with my current problems, like how am I going to get my Dad to buy me a Dreamcast?</p><p>A brilliant friend of mind once said that history should serve one purpose: to scare you. Because anyone in history who attained truly great things and was happy had to go out of their minds to do it. And I completely agree with that. But let's be honest, most people won't do that.</p><p>So the next best thing I guess is to use history to make some pretty dope memes, like these people did.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Don't do it Romulus!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>If you wanna know the history <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">of Romulus and Remus</a>, it gets pretty weird right from the beginning. I mean these dudes were apparently nursed by a wolf, so I kind of believe that this meme is exactly how things went down.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Why Carthage, of all places?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Mummies need to get over themselves.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>First of all you're dead, and second of all, only two of the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies were actually good that third one with dragon Jet-Li was so awful so don't act like you're above getting your bandages used to butt-relief.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Geography is weird.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>But I'll tell you this much - I would've loved it a heck of a lot more if they made it more about identifying animals and less about cities and capitals and all that boring stuff.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. It's all about salting those fields.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Legend has it the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> fields of Carthage were salted</a> so nothing would ever grow there again, effectively making the place inhabitable. Who would fight for salted land? No one.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. That giant horse story always seemed kinda dumb to me.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The Trojan horse had to be an inside job. Who the heck looks at a giant wooden horse and is like, yeah sure thing let's wheel it into our city.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. So true.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>News flash: the Hunger Games was never cool. It was for like a second and then once the second movie dropped you were like, "OK this is played out" and then they dragged out the third book-movie into a two-parter and you stopped watching them in theaters and just waited for them to stream then fell asleep.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. The nerd in class who did this...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Talk about social outcast, right? I was a teacher's pet and even I wouldn't do this nonsense. Clean up the classroom? Sure. But there's a difference between being a pet and a narc.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. The Greek and Roman gods loved puns.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Their most favorite children's author used them all the time. His name was Dr. Zeus.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Memes have always been around.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Would've been even better if it was a three-headed doge. Cerberus pupper, wow Hades, much loyalty.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. The problem with this...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Is that I just read it all as a bunch of nouns. Bird river food dinner water fork...like what're you trying to tell me, Cleo?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Puns on puns on puns.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>I always wondered where the word "knight" came from. I mean if you want to believe <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this bit of history, you could</a>, but I think this meme provides the real answer.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. Hate when that happens.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>You know maybe if the 300 Spartans had that extra guy who didn't run back to turn his oven off, they could've held off the Persians for an extra day or two.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. Bubonic Plague.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Was it tragic? Yes, but also full of hilarious examples of people who don't use methodology or any real knowledge to troubleshoot an issue. Like a bunch of people got spooked out by black cats as the cause of the disease so they started murdering them en masse. Which only helped the rats breed and spread the plague more. You can only write this stuff.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. Anubis is the G</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Legend has it that there are two types of kids: Greek mythology nerds and Egyptian mythology nerds. I have to be honest I was never really into Egyptology, but if I saw this meme when I was younger, I think I would've felt differently.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16. Nero</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Imagine being a total psychopath and getting to rule the greatest civilization of all time. Of course you'd play a fiddle while the city burned, who cares? You've got bigger things to worry about, like which one of the gods is trying to hoodwink you into eating a porcupine so they can sleep with your wife.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">17. We don't do geography in the US</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Seriously, I didn't have a geography class in public school growing up. I probably couldn't even name 20 state capitals off the top of my head, and half of the ones I could are probably wrong if we're being honest.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">18. Robert E. Lee</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>I often think about the one dude who invested heavily in the confederacy and then had a bunch of dollars sitting around in a treasure chest somewhere. Like, how did he feel once it was announced that the game was up? Must feel like those peeps who invested heavily in Bitcoin now.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">19. Oh Henry...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Imagine being the friend of someone who was set to marry Henry VIII after his first two or three marriages? Like what do you say to them? What do you put in the card? "Hey hope you aren't publicly executed! XOXO you guys are perfect!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">20. Shout out to the feudal system.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Talk about a process that made sure the dons stayed in power. They were basically like little organized gangs and everyone was repping their colors and going to contests to flex how great they were.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">21. Kids these days.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>I keep thinking of Anthony Hopkins from that horrible Noah movie, digging for berries when the flood is coming. It's like, What're you doing old man? Just get on the boat, Dude loved his berries.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">22. Famine's never funny.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>But it is sort of insane that I get to live in a day and age where there's so much food that it's actually a problem. Seriously, have you ever sat in a Cheesecake Factory and just felt overwhelmed by how much is going on there? It's wild.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">23. Henry VIII</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>To say that this guy had problems with women would be a real understatement. Now usually, when guys have girl problems in this day and age they either blog angrily about it and upvote men-inist memes on Reddit, or create Facebook. But when you're an English king, you do crazy things like murder and create a new religion.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">24. Julius Caesar</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>On the real though, that must really suck when you get backstabbed by someone who you thought was your boy. I still haven't forgotten the time I shard donuts with this kid I was cool with in the second grade, and he didn't return the favor the following week. Jerk.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">25. Franklin Delano COOLsevelt</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>FDR's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"New Deal"</a> brought about a string of new public programs designed to protect U.S. citizens, but, like anything you can't charge people for, it had its critics. Not that it bothered FDR, hence the sunglasses.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">26. No kings here.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Fun fact: they tried making Washington king of the United States, to which he (probably) said, "I think you mother$*#!ers are missing the point of this whole English liberation thing."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">27. Puns + History</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Go together like communism and American political alarmism. Or communism and famine.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">28. Foreclosures suck...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>But getting your entire way of life foreclosed on is even worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yes, they went there.
