I was also questioning my energy levels.</p><p>Imagine my shock, then, when I learned that this week <a href=#>Dame Julia Peyton-Jones has become a mother</a> for the first time at age 64.</p><p>To say I was staggered would be an under-statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict0002425644691.jpg><p>This dame, currently living on the west coast of the US, made my contemplations a decade ago look like child’s play.</p><p>Apparently, by modern standards, 40 is positively pre-school in the motherhood stakes.</p><p>On a more profound note though, it’s very hard to get your head around someone becoming a mother at an age which is not only well past the menopause but is just a grey hair short of a pension.</p><p>Bodies aren't designed to have babies in 60s<br></p><p>It reeks of selfishness — an utter disregard for the fact that the child brought into the world (whether by <a href=#>IVF</a> or surrogate) may not have a mother around for many years due to her old age.</p><p>I sincerely hope that Dame Julia enjoys a long life, for her daughter Pia’s sake, but what are the chances?</p><p>I accept that any of us can drop dead at a moment’s notice — but it is less likely when you’re in your thirties or forties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000004462044-e1484784498443.jpg><p>I’ve tried to get my head around wanting a child at that age. I’m menopausal now and finally — as I approach my 50th — my maternal desires have vanished. I no longer look at a pregnant woman or a newborn and coo with longing and hope.</p><p>There is a very good reason for that — it’s biological.</p><p>Our bodies are not designed to have babies in our 60s, and even if this child was conceived via a surrogate, it does not change the fact that women’s falling fertility as we pass 35 is because we are not as capable of coping with the demands of motherhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000295242790.jpg><p>At the age of 49, with my youngest aged eight-and-a-half, I fully admit that I don’t have the energy (and perhaps even patience) that I had when I had my firstborn at 27.</p><p>But perhaps not everyone is a hands-on mum. Some people have people who “do” motherhood for them.</p><p>How, for example, will this 64-year-old woman be able to run after a toddler when her own joints might be aching and creaking? Will little Pia be forced to push her mother around in a wheelchair when she’s ten because Mummy struggles with her mobility?</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p><a href=#>IVF has done amazing things for women’s fertility</a>. Women are able to conceive well into their 40s, if they have decided to hold off to climb the career ladder or struggled to conceive for years.</p><p>I think it’s truly amazing what is possible. But just because we can, doesn’t mean we should.</p><p>I’ve heard it said that the end of natural pregnancy for women is 53, which seems very old to me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000249519276.jpg><p>Britain’s oldest mum is believed to Sue Tollefsen, who gave birth at 57 to daughter Freya. But 64 is considerably older.</p><p>And whether by natural or surrogate means, the end product remains the same.</p><p>Some might argue that there are double standards at play here when it is acceptable for Rolling Stone <a href=#>Ronnie Wood to father twins with wife Sally Humphreys</a> just before his 69th birthday.</p><p>Well, for the record, I don’t think it is. But an early biology lesson will confirm that his “input” is considerably less than a woman who carries a baby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000295271554.jpg><p>And while I’m sure Ronnie is an amazing dad, I can’t see him getting up for night feeds and running his wee bairns around the park every afternoon.</p><p>Apart from anything else, he can pay staff to do that.</p><p>No, I feel becoming a mother at 64 is not only selfish but irresponsible.</p><p>We need to take our cue from nature</p><p>And that goes for all those who facilitated this.</p><p>Just like the IVF unit in Romania that made Adriana Iliescu a mum in 2005 at the age of 66 (and 230 days) is nothing if not, irresponsible.</p><p>Because we can — and can charge for it — doesn’t mean we should show a disregard for the physical and societal implications for the mothers’ and babies’ lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000267530811.jpg><p>I find it sad that a woman should consider motherhood for the first time in her sixties.</p><p>Whatever the reasons may be for why it hadn’t happened before, they do not make the possibility and medical advancement any more acceptable or palatable.</p><p>What is needed is a sobering conversation with oneself to acknowledge that we need to take our cue from nature.</p><p>Motherhood is not a God-given right, nor is it an ageless possibility.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4N2fJFra2ickaKybrbUpaCaZaCaxrW7zWahqKaVqHqqv4ysnKWemai1bq3NnWSiqqKawLG7zaygm6SVYsGwecGeZJplnaq6bq3TZm1tZaOWxrR51KWpoqORYrewutKspqdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
