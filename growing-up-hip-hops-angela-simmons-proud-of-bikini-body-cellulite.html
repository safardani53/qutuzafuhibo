In a bright orange, cut-out one-piece that looks like a bikini, Simmons, 31, sunned herself with pals, jumped from their catamaran and rode a jet ski.</p><p>Simmons is the daughter of the legendary <strong>Rev. Run</strong> of Run–DMC. An avid gym goer, she founded the fitness program <a href=# rel=noopener>Built Not Bought</a>, an eight-week workout plan that promotes putting in the time to develop a fit lifestyle and setting long-term goals rather than focusing on short-term <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a>.</p><p>The reality star frequently posts workout and bikini shots on her Instagram account with body-positive messages. The day before she hit the ocean in Barbados, she shared a <a href=# rel=noopener>photo of herself in a sports bra</a> and spandex shorts. “Didn’t want to workout today … still did it,” she captioned the pic. “Side bar : Just because you work out doesn’t mean all cellulite disappears … natural body ! And proud.” She later posted a photo of herself in a full wheel yoga position, captioning it: “Sunsets n BackBends ☀️.”</p><p>Her dedication to exercise isn’t new. “I work out all the time anyway!” she told Us Weekly of her routine in 2015, adding that she’ll ramp up her boxing efforts and do “a little extra cardio” and “a little fasting” if she wants to work off indulgences.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Simmons is the mother of 2-year-old Sutton Joseph with her former fiancé, the late Sutton Tennyson. (The businessman was found tragically <a href=# rel=noopener>shot to death</a> in front of his Atlanta home in November 2018). Less than two weeks after welcoming son SJ in 2016, the wellness warrior was <a href=# rel=noopener>back in the gym</a>, posting a photo with the caption, “Light workouts approved by the DOC. #13DaysPostBaby #Day1Gym.”</p><p>Scroll through to see athletic Simmons having a blast in Barbados!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNktLO71qKloGWlpXqptc9mn6ioo2Kur7PEpZhmq5miurC60manq6elmXqwsoyboKShnp56o7vDsmScnZyhwq21055m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
