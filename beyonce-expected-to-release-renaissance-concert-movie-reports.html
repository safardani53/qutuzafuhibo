Several fans noted via social media that shows in Beyoncé’s hometown, Houston, seemed to be filmed.</p><p>Beyoncé previously directed her Homecoming concert film in 2018 as well as visual albums for Lemonade (2016) and Black Is King (2020). Homecoming was the first of her three-film deal with Netflix. It isn’t clear whether the Renaissance movie could eventually hit the streaming platform as part of that deal.</p><p>Variety notes that the Texas native is expected to sign a deal much like Swift’s. Since Beyoncé is going through the theater rather than a movie studio, she’ll get a bigger payday — taking home more than 50 percent of the worldwide box office.</p><p>Swift’s <a href=#>Eras Tour movie</a> will debut on October 13. Swift is on stage for upwards of three hours during her live shows, but the film’s run time is listed as two hours and 45 minutes.</p><p>The Eras Tour movie broke AMC’s single-day U.S. presale records, earning more than $26 million on the first day. <a href=#>The Exorcist: Believer moved</a> to October 6 just to avoid conflicting with the pop star. Swift’s movie could earn over $100 million on opening weekend, easily giving her the biggest opening ever for a concert movie. However, Beyoncé’s Renaissance movie could give Swift a run for her money.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Queen Bey’s tour surpassed the highest-grossing tour for a solo female act, previously set by <a href=#><strong>Madonna</strong></a> in 2009, <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times </a>reported, and generated an estimated $4.5 billion for the U.S. economy. It’s estimated that Swift generated about the same economic activity throughout her tour — a fact Beyoncé’s mom, <a href=#><strong>Tina Knowles</strong></a>, celebrated on Friday, September 29.</p><p>“This is so awesome ! To b able to stimulate the economy is no small feat! @beyonce And ! @taylorswift!” Knowles wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “Just being young women and being able to say this , is so awesome!!! Proud of them both !”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmesZ%2BjsKZ5xLGnnpukmrFuwM5mqZ6klZbApnnRnqWaoaOorq%2BvxGaaqKaTmr%2B1ecyoraKdXaeysbvRrapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
