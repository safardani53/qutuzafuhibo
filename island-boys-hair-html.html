Their <a href=# rel=follow>feud involving&nbsp;Jake&nbsp;Paul</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>podcast walkout involving</a> <a href=# rel=follow>Logan Paul</a>&nbsp;and his gang, <a href=# rel=follow>Bryce Hall</a>, and a few other people, and not to mention their music, have made headlines for a long time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But, none of those is as unique a thing to recognize them from as their hairstyle is, or rather, was. The Florida natives have gotten a new haircut, getting rid of their signature hairstyles. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And the reactions have been mixed, to say the least.</p><h2>Island Boys Have a New Hairstyle</h2><p>Kodiyakredd, one of the island boys, took to TikTok on April 15, 2022, to reveal their new haircuts. He posted a video where they were at a barbershop, getting their signature locks chopped off.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The video began with the barber chopping off one of the brothers'&nbsp;blonde hair. Then the video cut&nbsp;to reveal the boys' new haircut, which looked&nbsp;like a tapered skin fade. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Then, they got&nbsp;a hair wash&nbsp;and further adjustments until the desired result came about — a skin fade buzz cut.</p><p>After all the trimming and styling, Island Boys have a clean buzz cut with their natural hair color — black.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The brothers have uploaded numerous videos since this one, responding to fan comments and discussing their plans with the new look. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Island Boys have gotten a new haircut, letting go of their unique signature hairstyle.</strong> (Photo: Kodiyakredd/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Some comments are positive, with people praising the new looks and the change. However, <a href=# rel="follow noopener">some are ridiculing</a> the brothers' decision to change their appearance so drastically. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Island Boys Made Fun of for Their New Haircut</h2><p>Island Boys' hairstyles were always polarizing. Some loved it, while others absolutely hated it.</p><p>All these reactions have been showing up on the brothers' recent TikTok posts since they revealed their new looks. And they have responded to a fair few over the past few days.</p><p>"Way better" are the two words many have reacted with following the haircuts. They made it clear that the boys look much better with the wicks gone.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"FINALLY! no more crunchy," one user said in one post. "It’s about time! Actually looks a lot better," said another.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"I’m here for this," chimed in a third as another user just wrote, "Cuuuuuuuttteee."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But the negative and troll comments got all the attention. Somebody called the brothers "The Coconut Boys," and they&nbsp;couldn't help but respond to that. They freestyled their response and defended their haircut, saying they looked "so good."</p><p>A faction also joked Lalo, a fellow Florida creator, bullied them into cutting their "French frys" hair. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for their plans, the brothers are planning to grow curls,&nbsp;something the fans, too, want.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Responding to someone's comment about their hair being perfect for getting waves, they said they first wanted to get curly hair. They agreed that it was a good idea, and they had gone down the wavy hair route before.</p><p>After that, though, they did not know what style choices they would make.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"Trust the process" was their main catchphrase with these changes. They wanted all their fans to wait and see their style evolution over the coming months.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKGjoa6vsIybprKrXZ2uqr6NoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
