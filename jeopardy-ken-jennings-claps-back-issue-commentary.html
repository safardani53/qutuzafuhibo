You do just the right amount of commentary, like a pro."</p><p>"Do not stop the commentary- you add a lot to the show!" wrote another.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"Interesting," a third simply wrote on the particularly spicy back-and-forth exchange.</p><p>"Please find a way to make 'a**wagon' a <a href=#>Jeopardy! clue</a>," begged a fifth.</p><p>A sixth agreed: "Meh… I mean if you're just gonna read the answers might as well get a <a href=#>ChatGPT</a> [bot] to do it."</p><p>"I would've said Watson but that would've been a low blow," they added, referencing how the 74-time winner once lost to an IBM computer.</p><h2>KEN'S COMMENTS</h2><p>The contestant-turned-host's first official stint as presenter began in September.</p><p>He has admittedly been clocked by some critics for ad-libbing in a way they've accused could affect gameplay.</p><p>Particularly, Ken was called out when <a href=#>21-day winner Cris Pannullo</a> was winning big this fall.</p><p>During one game <a href=#>well into Cris' $748K streak</a>, Ken called the player's impressive ability to rack up massive amounts of money by finding Daily Doubles a <a href=#>"spidey sense."</a></p><p>"Well, you've found them all again but you're one for two,” Ken also told the champ later in that game - seeming to imply he should wager high to increase his lead.</p><p><a href=#>During Mattea Roach's 23-game run</a> last season, Ken also started opening the show with monologues about Mattea in front of the new players.</p><p>In one, he noted that they&nbsp;were&nbsp;<a href=#>Canadian, before listing other people, places, and things from the country.</a></p><p>One fan slammed: "It's really annoying because Ken Jennings more than anyone should know his talking, his favoritism, all of it is unfair. WTF?"</p><p>Ken was also accused of egging on&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schneider</a>&nbsp;during her 27th win of an eventual 40.</p><p>Ken said before one <a href=#>Final Jeopardy</a>: "I bet you [Amy] would like to have $1,401 more right now because this is not a runaway."</p><p>Pointing out exactly how much she should wager seemed a bit much, and in the past months, Ken has done less ad-libbing in terms of gameplay.</p><h2>'NOPE'</h2><p>Over the summer,&nbsp;Ken and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>, 47, were announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late longtime host, Alex Trebek.</a></p><p><a href=#>Alex tragically passed away</a>&nbsp;from pancreatic cancer at age 80 in 2020, leaving huge shoes to fill, and it took two&nbsp;<a href=#>drama-filled</a>&nbsp;years to fill them.</p><p>The game show's first host pick,&nbsp;<a href=#>Mike Richards</a>,&nbsp;who was coincidentally also its executive producer at the time, was ousted after a week of episodes when he was discovered to have made&nbsp;<a href=#>sexist comments.</a></p><p>Ken's first hosting stint is coming to an end as Mayim is switching in&nbsp;<a href=#>starting mid-February</a>.</p><p>When Mayim gets her due, she'll be<a href=#>&nbsp;starting with a teen tournament</a>&nbsp;which will then lead to more regular episodes.</p><p>Fans will be getting more of Ken as he will be hosting the new&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy! Masters</a>&nbsp;spinoff, which is scheduled to air during the spring in primetime.</p><p>Last month a Twitter user implied <a href=#>Ken was actually better than the late Alex.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>They wrote: "Hot take: Ken Jennings is better than Alex Trebek. Good night, everyone."</p><p>The host swiftly replied with an all-caps: "NOPE."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/jeopardy-host-alex-trebek-l-710946579.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-01-at-2.20.09-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/champ-troy-meyer-holds-back-792372868.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYm1%2FeH6VaKGep6CWv6XFjKScp2Wamruvtc2gqmabnJa9tHnBmpqkZZmowLaxjJympqWVo8Givtho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
