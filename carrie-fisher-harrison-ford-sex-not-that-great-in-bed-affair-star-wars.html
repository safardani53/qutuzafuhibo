Rumors began swirling that she thought the action-star was “bad in bed,” but overlooked his lack of skills&nbsp;simply because he was so “handsome!” However, she’s since denied these claims entirely, telling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. “Any reports claiming I said Harrison was bad in bed are utterly false.”&nbsp;It looks like <strong>Princess Leia</strong> is setting the record straight!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Carrie admitted their undeniable connection&nbsp;started at creator <strong>George Lucas</strong>‘ 32nd birthday party. In the book, she explained how her male crew members were encouraging her to&nbsp;have a drink, when Harrison, who portrayed <strong>Han Solo</strong>, finally stepped in. She claimed, “Mr. Ford thew my virtue and me into the backseat of his studio car and commanded the driver to ‘Go! GO!’” She added how this was when they shared their first kiss, before taking&nbsp;a detour to&nbsp;Carrie’s place. She was absolutely infatuated with him at the time, questioning,&nbsp;“How could you ask such a shining specimen of a man to be satisfied with the likes of me?”</p><h3><a class=pmclinkcontent-post href=# rel=noopener>Carrie Fisher & Harrison Ford Photos</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Carrie’s tell-all authorial debut will be released Nov. 22 and features journal entries that she&nbsp;kept while filming. She&nbsp;also explained why she’s telling her story at this point. “I didn’t say anything to anybody for years but it’s not like anyone’s deeply affected by it anymore.” On the plus side, Carrie did&nbsp;give her co-star a heads up before disseminating it to the public. She revealed, “He went, ‘Lawyer!’” adding that she also sent him a draft for notes — but didn’t receive any from him. At the time of their alleged affair, he was married to his first wife, <strong>Mary Marquardt</strong>,&nbsp;with two children. Despite all this, she’s admitted to having the utmost respect for her co-star.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>HollywoodLifers,</strong> will YOU be reading Carrie’s tell-all book?!
