This new series, set in 1980s Kuwait, will star Rawan Mahdi as Farida and Mona Hussain as Munira. The show will debut on Netflix on February 8, 2023, at 3 p.m. EST.</p><p>A trailer for The Exchange was just published by Netflix. The vivid and fast-paced trailer introduces us to Kuwait’s banking sector in 1987 while also providing us a look of the two starring females who will form the story’s crust. The narrative will become evident only when we see The Exchange, but it appears that this will be a story of two women struggling to maintain their own in a society dominated by males. Among the cast members of The Exchange are Mohammed Almansour, Jasem Alnabhan, Hussain Almahdi, Faisal Alamiri, Maryam Alsalih, and Esmahan Tawfiq. Continue reading for more information about the next series.</p><h2>The trailer for The Exchange on Netflix.</h2><p>The long and detailed teaser for the forthcoming six-part program explains everything the series intends to bring to the table. The Middle East is infamous for its gender imbalance. Netflix is getting ready to plunge into the Arabian Nights and illustrate how two ladies in the 1980s opted to swim against the flow.&nbsp;The teaser also stated that the series is based on actual events, implying that it is a part of American history. The trailer portrays how the males do not want involvement in “their” world of business, ultimately leading to significant conflict between them and Farida and Munira after a long introduction to women and the world of banking. Farida and Munira will be intriguing characters with their own storylines as well.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Exchange-1.jpg alt="The Exchange" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The show’s synopsis is as follows:</p><p>“Set in Kuwait in 1988, on the brink of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of the nation, two women make their way in the boys club of the Kuwait Stock Exchange.”</p><p>Nadia Ahmad, Anne Sobel, and Adam Sobel founded The Exchange. In an interview with Variety, Ahmad and producer Abdullah Boushahri disclosed a lot about the project, including their vision for it. Nadia Ahmad apparently chose this topic due to her own financial background.</p><p></p><p>Nadia Ahmad explained in the interview:</p><p>“Investment banking was a significant deal in Kuwait in the 1970s and 1980s. There was enough money to go around, but there weren’t enough people managing it, you know what I mean? … My mother was a single mother who was totally responsible for my financial well-being.</p><p>Ahmad went on to say:</p><p>So she went into investment banking, and I was always surrounded by women who were doing the same thing, who were breaking preconceptions about Khaleeji [Arabic Peninsula] women. These women were trailblazers, the first to enter these male-dominated arenas.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Exchange-2.jpg alt="The Exchange" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>During the same interview, Boushahri remarked on the subject, saying:</p><p>“It’s a workplace narrative, so it’s quite difficult to make it amusing. So, at first, the topic seemed to be quite difficult. I was concerned about joining a program that would be only about offices and individuals, making it difficult for viewers to follow.”</p><p>The Exchange will be available on Netflix on February 8, 2023.
