We get up, we do swim class in the bathtub.”</p><p>It is unclear when Cooper caught up with Ramos, 28, as the Oscar nominee was <a href=#>photographed at a beach in Malibu</a> with his daughter and former Alias costar <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a> on August 5. More recently, he was spotted filming scenes for a movie directed by <strong>Paul Thomas Anderson</strong>.</p><p>The Silver Linings Playbook star has always had a close bond with his mom, but their relationship became even stronger after his father, Charles Cooper, <a href=#>died in January 2011</a> from lung cancer.</p><p>“My family is very close, and my dad dying was brutal for all of us. It was a schism, and its aftershock has not stopped. And we need each other. So here we are,” he told Details magazine in May 2013. “But don’t get me wrong. It’s not without complications. It’s not like I live in a compound and she’s in the guesthouse. No. She’s <a href=#>in the next room</a>. But here’s the thing: She’s a cool chick. We can hang, and she can roll with the punches. If that wasn’t the case, there’s no way.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bradley has since brought Campano to several events, including the <a href=#>2019 SAG Awards</a> and <a href=#>Oscars</a>.</p><p>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19, Us Weekly wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
