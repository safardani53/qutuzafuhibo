By 13, he was throwing dunks and won dunk contests at 14.</p><p>Vernon Scheavalie, aka Schea, then played collegiate basketball at Long Beach City College (1998-99) and the University of Alabama (1999-2000).</p><p>Forgoing his two years of college eligibility, Cotton declared for the 2000 NBA draft but went undrafted.</p><p>It depressed him to the point that he had thoughts of suicide before his girlfriend and family convinced him.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Paul Pierce</a> and Kevin Garnett, the NBA stars from his era, state that his gameplay still lives on their minds. Moreover, Garnett even referred to Cotton as Lebron before <a href=#>LeBron James</a>.</p><p>Later, Schea spent ten years bouncing around France, China, Yugoslavia, and Venezuela. Now, he is the CEO of Schea Cotton Basketball Academy.</p><h2>Schea Cotton Brother, James Cotton: What Is Their Age Gap?</h2><p>Born on May 20, 1978, Schea is the youngest of two children. He has an older brother, James Cotton, who is also a former basketball player like him.</p><p>James was born on December 14, 1975, and is 48 years old as of 2024. The Cotton brothers have an age gap of two years and five months.</p><p>His older brother doesn’t make media appearances these days.</p><p>In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>USA Today</a>, he addressed his younger brother Schea’s phenomenal basketball abilities. He stated that if social media existed in their time, his brother ‘would have gone pro out of junior high.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cottons-Older-Brother-James-With-His-Wife-Tamara.jpg><p>James Wesley Cotton Jr. is a married man and lives with his wife, Tamara Cotton. According to the latter’s Facebook post, they married in August 2015.</p><p>His wife, Tamara, is a <a href=# rel=noopener>real estate agent</a> at Wesley Homes and Financial. On the other, James’ current profession is not out.</p><p>During college, he was a shooting guard at Long Beach State (1993–1997).</p><p>Then, he became the 2nd round pick of the Denver Nuggets in the 1997 NBA draft before they transferred the rights to the Seattle Supersonics.</p><p>With the Supersonics, Cotton Jr. played two seasons before his trade to the Chicago Bulls for <a href=#>Brent Barry</a>. Subsequently, the Bulls waived him, which ended his NBA career & eventually his basketball journey.</p><h2>Schea Cotton’s Family Tree</h2><p>The former basketball player was born as one of two children to African-American parents, Gaynell Cotton and James Cotton Sr.</p><p>Reportedly, his father was a contractor/construction worker who died in 2014.</p><p>His late father had named Schea after singer Maurice Chevalier. However, after kids found it difficult to pronounce “Chevalier,” his name turned out to be “Schea.”</p><p>In 1990, Cotton’s family moved from San Pedro, California, to Cypress, South California,&nbsp; due to gang concerns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Schea-Cotton-With-His-Mother-And-Older-Brother.jpg><p>Shea’s parents were very supportive of his passion for basketball.</p><p>When the NCAA stopped his college enrollment, disallowing his SAT scores, his family sued the NCAA in September 1998 for targeting Cotton without any wrongdoing.</p><p>The case was settled after four months, and subsequently, he got a college basketball scholarship at the University of Alabama.</p><h3>Cotton Has A Daughter</h3><p>Shea Cotton is yet to speak if he has a wife or girlfriend. But he is the father of a daughter, Chole.</p><p>In an April 2020 <a href=# rel=noopener>interview with Bardo’s Breakdown</a>, the former basketball player mentioned his daughter and stated she was into athletics.</p><p>Moreover, he added that he and his baby mama were no longer together, “I’m not with the mother.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cotton-With-His-Daughter-Chloe.jpg><p>Cotton’s daughter, Chloe, is an attendant at Downey High School in Downey, California.</p><p>In his Instagram post of June 2022, he posted a picture with his baby girlfriend and congratulated her on her 8th-grade graduation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC%2FwqGcmmWTpMG1u81mmaunpJ2ys3nJmqSeq12YvLXAzqdkmp%2BVYrSivIyapZ1llpa6qrjYZqurnZVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
