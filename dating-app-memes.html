How does anyone find love? If the future of the human race depends on people meeting on apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge, I'm not sure we even have to worry about global warming rendering our species extinct.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet we all have that one friend who found their freaking soulmate by randomly swiping right at 2 a.m. — so here you are, still swiping, still having appalling DM conversations and even more disappointing first dates.&nbsp;</p><p>But hey, if you don't laugh about it, you'll cry — and at least you can take comfort in the knowledge that you're not alone in your misery. Dating has probably always been brutal, but at least now we have social media where we can commiserate with hilarious, relatable memes.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sometimes, you actually manage to meet someone promising!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>You really like them, and you think they really like you back, only to learn this expression means very different things to each of you. You're fantasizing about a mini weekend getaway and they are about two texts exchanges away from ghosting.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It's so hard to find someone you can fancy as much as they fancy you.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Without fail, the only people who send you super likes are absolute trolls and folks whose profiles include some appalling bios. And yet you keep looking because maybe, just maybe, this time it'll be the person of your dreams. We truly are suckers for love.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Our standards for what's a good ice breaker have definitely changed...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>One positive thing you can say for online dating is it's really allowed people with common interests to find each other. This has probably been a leg up for those of us with hobbies lots of people find weird or off-putting. Look, if you're not into true crime, just go ahead and swipe left. If you want to talk about The Staircase over four beers, slide into my DMs!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The trouble is getting those people to even read your bio, though...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>If you're a 7 or higher, online dating certainly isn't without problems, but you probably enjoy a wider selection, just because the apps are so photo-driven. But for people who are, shall we say, less conventionally attractive, it can be a bummer sometimes.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But when you get a match, boy oh boy...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>...do you drop everything to feel it out. After all, you don't want to miss a good opportunity. But nine times out of ten, the conversation goes nowhere for one of three reasons:</p><p>1) they never respond to your witty opening message.</p><p>2) They quickly demonstrate conversation isn't their strong suit.</p><p>3) You realize you must have been drunk, very sad, or both when you swiped right.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sometimes by the time you open the app, they've unmatched you...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>"Geez, it can't be something I said. I literally didn't say anything!" you think. And then it slowly dawns on you that they swiped right by mistake. That really stings. You can actually picture them recoiling as they realize their mistake. Ouch.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Whoever said pictures don't lie clearly never did online dating.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>It's kinda unfair to fault people for using the most flattering angles and lighting they can in their profile pics. But it does tend to set folks up for disappointment should their match progress to an in-person date.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Plus, with filters and Facetune, people are editing themselves so much they're almost unrecognizable IRL. My advice is to always do one FaceTime chat before meeting, which tends to be harder to finesse with smoke and mirrors than a still image.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Personality does go a long way, but...</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Look, I get it. I'm a 5 at best. But at some point, you are going to want to interact with your significant other in the real world. In most cases, you're not going to charm someone so much they aren't ever going to care what you look like. Just bite the bullet and show us your face. Everyone is beautiful in their own way and all that.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Before you meet IRL, you gotta do a background check.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>We all have that friend who fancies herself the Veronica Mars of dating and can give you a full bio in the time it takes you to type your date's name into Google. She's a real one, keep on her good side, because she's your best defense against the creeps of the world.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Of course, sometimes you can spot a creep without a deep dive into their social media...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>...in which case, you need someone to be a sounding board for that completely unsolicited "eggplant" or the appalling pickup line someone thought would be cute and not at all weird or gross coming from a legit stranger.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Swipe fatigue is real.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>After a while, it starts to feel like everyone who's still single is total garbage. But then, finally, you go on a real date in the real world with another real human!&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And then another, and then another, and then another...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>It's hard not to feel demoralized after a series of first dates, each more disappointing than the last. Even if you're as attracted to them in person as you were online, people can sometimes really sparkle in text and then be impossible to talk to face to face.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Especially when they go on about a topic you don't care about.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Personally, I don't mind talking about astrology, but we've all been on that date with someone who talks endlessly about a topic you know nothing about and aren't interested in. And all the while, they never seem to notice any of the nonverbal cues indicating you're desperate to change the subject.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But hey, at least you get a fun story out of it.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>You might not find true love, but at least you're building a catalog of amusing anecdotes. As much as we're all suckers for a great romance or a sweet meet-cute, dating disaster stories really kill at parties.</p><p>Good luck out there, and remember there's no shame in dying alone!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma61tc2gZJqooGK6prnErA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
