Are you up for this nakedness," she asked looking around the set, before saying "alright, here we go," and clicking her fingers to reveal the four naked.</p><p>They sat on the set's couches with cushions strategically placed to cover their bits as Gemma protested, "I didn't sign up for this".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000651964655.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000651964649.jpg><p>"Right we better go before we see Alan's johnson," Steph joked as the camera panned to a shocked looking Alan.</p><p>Elsewhere in the show, Luke read the One O’Clock Views in the altogether, while John Whaite became a naked chef and gardener Michael Perry bared all outside on Leeds Dock.</p><p>Fans loved the cheeky moment and rushed to Twitter for a laugh about it.</p><p>"I’m so glad we never got to see Alan’s Johnson. That’s too much on a Friday arvo. Loved the show today. Well done to the lunch mates who got their kit off," wrote one Twitter user.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000651964648.jpg><p>Another added: "Seeing all you guys naked. The show will never be the same again after that *in a good way of course."</p><p>Earlier in the show, Steph interviewed two naturists about why they decided to embrace nudity.</p><p>Naturist Stephanie McManus explained: "I haven't had any negative comments at all, because who I'm being when I'm talking about it is I'm being powerful, I'm being empowering, I'm being liberating. And people see that.</p><p>"They feel that and they're just amazed and so happy for me because they've seen the struggles I've been through with my anorexia, my binge eating disorder, even struggling through bodybuilding."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000651964661.jpg><p>She added: "So I'm just a completely different person and they're in love with that, to the point where my mother has framed a photo of me naked and put it on her wall, which the last person I thought would really embrace my nudity."</p><p>Host Steph is no stranger to doing awkward things on her show after recently having a smear test live on air to show how easy a life-saving cervical screening examination can be.</p><p>The TV host had the test done on her Channel 4 show, Steph’s Packed Lunch on Channel 4, after speaking to a man who lost his partner to cervical cancer.</p><p>Lying on a medical table, Steph chatted to Dr Naomi Sutton who performed the test and suggested ways to help relax during the often uncomfortable and nerve-wracking procedure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000649847726.jpg><p>As her smear test was being performed, Steph said: “There are a lot women who struggle with going to their smear test because they think it’s going to be awful and embarrassing, so we decided to show you what actually happens."</p><p>“I’ve had my smear tests a number of times and they can be different each time. Sometimes you don’t feel anything. Now it feels pretty ok but sometimes they can hurt, or people worry it’s going to hurt. But it’s not for long, even if there is a little bit of pain.”</p><p>Steph added: “It’s not the most comfortable experience in the world. This isn’t hurting, it just feels weird.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000649847696.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>After the test was completed, Steph sat up to continue chatting to Dr Naomi.</p><p>“That took 30 seconds or something, it can sometimes take slightly longer, getting into the position because it is hard to stay relaxed," Steph said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"This is embarrassing and it is sometimes uncomfortable and for some women it can be painful but it can save their life.”</p><p><strong>Steph’s Packed Lunch airs daily on Channel 4</strong> <strong>at 12.30pm.</strong></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Steph McGovern has a smear test live on her show it's not 'awful and embarrassing' and just 'feels weird' but can save your life</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmR%2FeYCTcmdyZ6OpsrG00manmpubmrFuuNSnmqFll5q6rq2MmqukoZ6ovK95zJyeqK6Vp7tuusCknJ1lnJ7DpnnTr2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
