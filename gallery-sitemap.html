It’s also meant to be served with warm Irish butter, which helps balance out the bread’s sweetness. Check out the recipe here.]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Thai-Soy-Garlic-Fried-Ribs.jpg?quality=40&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Thai Soy-Garlic Fried Ribs]]>&lt;![CDATA[These puppies are a favorite of Teigen’s daughter, Luna, and it’s easy to see why. They’re coated in a savory combo of soy sauce, garlic and pepper, but the real beauty of this recipe is that, unlike other rib dishes, it’s ready in about 30 minutes. Instead of smoking or baking ribs for hours, Teigen recommends frying them, which drastically reduces the cooking time. Here’s the recipe.]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lemony-Arugula-Spaghetti-Cacio-e-Pepe.jpg?quality=55&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Lemony Arugula Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe]]>&lt;![CDATA[Another Teigen staple is this take on an Italian classic, which is elevated thanks to some bitter arugula, crispy pancetta and zesty lemon juice.

Trythe recipe for yourself.]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Tom-Yum-Noodles.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Tom Yum Noodles]]>&lt;![CDATA[This dish is a standout in Teigen’s second tome, in which she refers to it as “ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RECIPES OF MY LIFE.” The Thai staple is inspired by a similar meal Teigen’s mom prepared for her when she was growing up. “We added top ramen instant noodles to her homemade broth to make it like my favorite ‘mama’ noodles (basically Thai flavored instant ramen) from childhood,” she wrote on Instagram in November 2016. “SOOOOOO good!!!” Check out the recipe here]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Carrot-Coconut-Soup.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Carrot Coconut Soup]]>&lt;![CDATA[This hearty-yet-healthy soup is another meal that has Luna’s seal of approval. As Teigen wrote on Instagram in February 2019: “Luna approved coconut carrot soup on my stories now! One of my favorite recipes in #cravingshungryformore (You would know if she hated it trust me.)

Here’s the recipe.]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jalapeño-Parmesan-Crusted-Grilled-Cheese.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Jalapeño Parmesan-Crusted Grilled Cheese]]>&lt;![CDATA[This comfort food classic gets a spicy boost thanks to thin jalapeño pepper slices that are brilliantly pressed into the bread for a powerful kick with every bite.
