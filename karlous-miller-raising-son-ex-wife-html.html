Fortunately, the same cannot be said for the American comedian/actor Karlous Bernard Miller.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Despite his busy comic schedule, the Mississippi native always takes out the time to spend with his only son, Ashton.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>The Father-Son Duo Enjoy Every Moment</h2><p>A father and son’s bond is always amazing and great to watch. The same bond is shown out by the comedian and his son, Ashton Micheal Miller. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The rapper&nbsp;has been relishing every bit of time he spends with his son ever since he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">welcomed</a>&nbsp;the kid&nbsp;on December 6, 2008, with his former partner, Ashina Franklin. He is so smitten&nbsp;by his son that he frequently&nbsp;manages&nbsp;to take time off his busy comic schedule. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A small example can be given in a&nbsp;February 2011&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube video</a>&nbsp;that <span>he&nbsp;</span>had uploaded through his self-titled YouTube channel. In the video titled ‘Karlous Miller—My baby can read,’ the father-son duo were seen sharing an adorable moment. In the latter part of the video, the comedian was seen making people laugh by sharing his son's funny stories.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The father and son’s unbreakable togetherness can also be witnessed through his former partner's social media posts. She is usually seen gushing about her former partner and her son's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unbreakable</a>&nbsp;bond in her posts, and the two boys always playing video games, leaving her uninvited. Likewise, she also posts about how <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">awesome</a> father Miller is and wishes him on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Father's Day</a> almost every year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Besides, the father and son have an adorable bond, but the mother also has a great bond with her son. She is constantly seen <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">flaunting pictures</a> with her son, and most recently, on December 6, 2020, she even posted a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lovely post</a> on the occasion of her son’s 12th birthday. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Relationship With His Baby’s Mother</h2><p>Although the former pair are constantly seen with their son and even sharing his&nbsp;details through social media,&nbsp;they are yet to shed light on their own relationship. Nonetheless, in&nbsp;Franklin's&nbsp;interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Comedy Hype</a>, on November 29, 2019, a few details about their relationship were disclosed.</p><p>In the interview, she revealed that she first met the comedian uptown alongside his two amigos, Smokey and Clayton. As a comedian herself, she decided to join the trio&nbsp;and later became close with everyone. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As time passed, the Mississippi and Alabama natives created a bond, and they eventually began dating. Their bond further strengthened after their son was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> on December 6, 2008.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>During the same interview, Franklin also mentioned how great their relationship was, how they never let their personal life interfere with their professional life, and how they had such respect&nbsp;for each other’s talent.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Sadly, the two talented comics decided to part their ways after some time due to undisclosed reasons. Nonetheless, both have maintained a healthy friendship to date and have done their absolute best to co-parent their only son. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnm5a%2FrbvUrGSmoZyhsrN50ZqgrKGenHq0u81mnLFlp56zpnrHraSl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
