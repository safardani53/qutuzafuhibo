The couple has trolled each other in the past – and when you’re dating 50 Cent, one of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>biggest</a> trolls on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>internet</a>, you need to be able to dish it out. For example, the time that Jamira <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>locked Fiddy out of the bedroom</a> because he insulted her homecooked meal. “Oh, now you want to come and lay in the bed? You’re sleeping on the couch [after how] you talkin’ about my cookin,’” she said in an IG clip while Fiddy pleaded to let her back in. Or, there was that time Fiddy teased how “after 3 days of quarantine,” he wished he “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>never met her at all</a>” after she “keep sending me up and down the stairs too much — f*ck this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cuban-link-calls-out-50-cent-for-small-bag-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Some people aren’t so forgiving of Fiddy’s online antics. After 50 Cent shared a meme that compared <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lil Kim</strong></a>’s outfit at the 2021 BET Awards to an owl, Kim re-shared the meme to her page and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called out</a> the “Candy Shop” rapper. After pointing out “the accuracy” of the “hilarious” meme, Lil Kim, 47, said that she isn’t “bothered not one bit. My family [and] friends more mad than me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Sh-t like this don’t move me one way or another cause I’m still a bad b-tch,” she said before turning her sights on Mr. Jackson. “[50 Cent], I see [you] are still in [your] feels about that dinner date [you] asked me on that I had to turn down. Let it go. [You] have a beautiful girlfriend. I have a loving husband. Let it go.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BsZpytkpa7brjIp6JmrKKkua2%2FjG5nZpuVo8FursCgZKmtoqiybr%2FIs5xmqJikwbB7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
