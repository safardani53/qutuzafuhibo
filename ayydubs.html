She is 27 years old and a Scorpio. She is an American citizen. Additionally, her given name is Alyx Weiss.</p><p>Alyx’s parents’ names and other identifying details remain unknown. However, she has three sisters named Jamie, Sam, and Zoe. Similarly, her mother is a New Jersey native who works as an oncologist and hematologist. Alyx currently resides in West Los Angeles, California, with her family. Additionally, Ayydubs’s favorite city is New Hampshire, which is home to her uncle’s lake property. Additionally, she visited the house twice a year as a child.</p><p>Alyx’s favorite television show is Sarah Silverman’s “I Love You, America” on Hulu. Additionally, she admires Sarah Silverman’s wit and sense of humor. Ayydub never misses an episode of this popular American television series. Additionally, she has an odd love for socks and owns a sizable collection. Additionally, she aspires to direct and produce television shows and live in a foreign place for an extended period.</p><p>Ayydub’s educational history and qualifications are unknown, as are the names of the educational institutions she attended or is currently enrolled in. And, given her age, she must have completed both high school and university unless she is a dropout or has chosen to discontinue further studies.</p><h2>Height and Weight</h2><p>Ayydubs is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 55 kilograms. Similarly, her other body dimensions, including her chest, waist, and hips, are 34-26-34 inches. Additionally, she has brown hair and brown eyes.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Ayydubs entered the social media arena because she was dissatisfied with her life. Similarly, she adored watching YouTube videos and wanted to start her own channel. Additionally, she was interested in beauty and fashion and quickly launched a YouTube channel called “ayydubs.” She began her channel on April 18, 2009, and has amassed a total of 172,647,220 views to date. Additionally, her first clothing haul was published in 2012.</p><p>For the first three years of her channel’s existence, Ayydubs was unsure of the type of content she should publish and share. However, she found an interest in comedy later in life. She then began making comedy-related content and quickly understood the genre. Her Youtube channel now features vlogs, advice videos, skits, and comedies, among other things. Additionally, Ayydubs reveals numerous embarrassing anecdotes and awkward events in her storytime videos that people would generally avoid sharing.</p><p>This trait drew many’s attention and ultimately aided in the growth of her channel. Soon afterward, she created an internet dating series called “Filming with My Tinder Date,” in which she discusses her experiences with “Tinder” dates. Later on, Ayydubs recognized that not everyone is brave enough to go on ‘Tinder’ dates, which is how she discovered the possibility for a series. Similarly, the series follows her humorous, embarrassing, and incredible experiences with ‘Tinder’ dates.</p><h2>Ayydubs Net worth in 2023</h2><p>According to statsmash, <strong>Ayydubs is believed to have a net worth of $322K as of October 2023,</strong> and her primary source of income is from YouTube.</p><h2>Ayydubs Boyfriend & Dating</h2><p>Ayydubs appears to be unmarried at the moment and appears to be concentrating her efforts on her career and YouTube. Or perhaps she wishes to keep her personal and romantic life separate from the social world. Additionally, focusing on her previous relationships, no information about her lover is available. As a result, we can reasonably presume that either Ayydubs has never been in a relationship or has done an excellent job of concealing it.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYsrGUqq%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
