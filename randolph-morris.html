He is the son of Ralph and Patricia Morris. Moreover, he had two brothers, Jonathan and William, in the family.</p><p>Born in Texas, he later moved to the Georgian state with his family. So, he attended the Landmark Christian Academy in Fairburn as a kid. His two brothers studied in the same school.</p><p>His brother, Jonathan, had become pretty good at playing basketball by that time. As he was rather tall and athletic, Randolph was interested in sports too.</p><p>So his elder brother had an early influence on him, and he began playing from a young age.</p><p>Jonathan studied Chemistry and also played college basketball for the University of Kentucky later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Randolph-Morris-with-Smith-and-Dwight-Howard-in-his-teens-1024x831.jpg><p>In the meantime, Morris kept playing good basketball and learned to master basic basketball skills before high school.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, he joined the AAU team named Atlanta Celtics and started playing organized tournaments for them.</p><p>While with the Celtics, he teamed up with Josh Smith and <a href=#>Dwight Howard</a>, who later played in the NBA. Unlike Morris, both Smith and Howard had successful NBA careers.</p><p>Morris eventually graduated high school in 2004 and joined the University of Kentucky for his higher studies.</p><h2>Randolph Morris | Basketball Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Morris played his high school basketball for the Landmark Christian School in Fairburn, Georgia. He demonstrated excellent prospects right from his early games, and consequently, his high school coach, Bryan Bartley, highly praised him.</p><p>Despite his colossal weight, he had graceful movements and was his team’s point-scoring machine. In addition, his stats clearly show how good he was at rebounding.</p><p>He averaged 23.0 points and 12.0 rebounds per game as a junior in the 2002-03 season.</p><p>For his impressive games throughout, he was selected to the All-State team continuously for three last high school seasons.</p><p>Furthermore, Morris averaged massive 23.0 points and 16.0 rebounds per game in his senior season. As a result, the player was selected for the McDonald’s All-American Game in 2004.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Ben Gordon: Career & Net Worth >>></strong></a></p><p>Likewise, various sports agencies, including Rivals.com, highly rated him at the time of his high school graduation. Many had speculated that he would directly go for the NBA draft, but he chose to play college basketball.</p><h3>College Career</h3><p>Randolph Morris had received scholarship offers from many basketball powerhouses, including Georgian Tech and Louisville. But he eventually decided to join the University of Kentucky for his college career.</p><p>As a freshman, Morris averaged 8.8 rebounds and 4.2 rebounds per game. After a fair start, he decided to go for the NBA draft in 2005, but it quickly misfired.</p><p>He went undrafted and soon returned to the Wildcats for the new college season. After his return to the college, Morris missed nearly half of the matches in his second season due to the NCAA rules.</p><p>However, he showed remarkable improvement since his first season and averaged 13.3 points and 6.0 rebounds per game as a sophomore.</p><p>Likewise, as a junior, he displayed his peak performance averaging 16.1 rebounds and 7.8 rebounds per game, for which he received first-team All-SEC honors in 2007.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><h4>Unsuccessful NBA Journey</h4><p>After he had gone undrafted in 2005, Morris had remained a free agent as per the NBA rules. Eventually, after two years of his failure, he signed a two-year contract with the New York Knicks on March 23, 2007.</p><p>Morris was doing well for the Wildcats in the NCAA, so the college administration had called him back, but he refused.</p><p>On the contrary, he was of little use for the Knicks, so they allowed him very little playtime in the year he signed with them.&nbsp;</p><p>He averaged 1.8 rebounds and 0.8 points in 8.8 minutes per game in his rookie season. Similarly, the club had him play around 18 matches in the second NBA season, in which he had very poor performance.</p><p>Eventually, he began playing for the Atlanta Hawks in the 2008 NBA Summer League, following which the club signed him on July 19, 2008.</p><p>Even though he spent two seasons with the Hawk, he did not get significant playtime there as well. No NBA clubs signed him after his deal with the Hawks expired after the 2009-10 season.</p><h4>Chinese League Career</h4><p>After finally realizing that his NBA career would take him nowhere, Randolph decided to play overseas and signed with the CBA club, the Beijing Ducks, before the 2011-12 season.</p><p>Morris received immediate recognition in the new league after making it to the CBA All-Star game in 2011. Moreover, he led the Ducks to their first-ever CBA title in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Morris-with-the-Beijing-Ducks-1024x1024.jpg><p>He became his team’s top performer as he finished his rookie season with an average of 23.1 points and 9.2 rebounds per game.</p><p>Randolph played five more CBA seasons with the Ducks and won two more league titles. He averaged over 20.0 points per game in every CBA season until he left the league in 2018.</p><p>Morris eventually announced his retirement from his professional career in 2019. At the time of his retirement, he was with the Lebanese club, Sporting Al Riyadi Beirut.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Some of his awards and achievements include:</p><ul><li>CBA champion (2012, 2014, 2015)</li><li>CBA Finals MVP (2014)</li><li>Lebanese Basketball League Champion (2019)</li><li>McDonald’s All-American (2004)</li><li>CBA All-Star (2011, 2014)</li><li>Third-team Parade All-American (2004)</li></ul><h2>Net Worth & Career Earnings</h2><p>The exact net worth of Randolph remains undisclosed, but various sources on the internet have estimated it to be somewhere between $1 million to $5 million.</p><p>Morris spent nearly twelve years of his productive time playing professional basketball, so league games were his primary source of income.</p><p>He had started his playing career in 2007 with the New York Knicks, which had paid him around $810,000 in his rookie season, although he had appeared in very few games.</p><p>However, he did not have enough game exposure and received low payment even after spending three more seasons in the NBA. In 2011, he flew abroad to play in the CBA.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Jabari Parker: Net Worth & Achievements >>></strong></a></p><p>He had earned around $2.5 million from his short NBA career.</p><h3>Tax Evasion Case</h3><p>In 2021, Randolph Morris faced a legal charge concerning wire fraud and tax evasion involvement.</p><p>According to sources, he was accused of deliberately submitting false income information to the revenue office in Kentucky. As per the indictment, he had earned around $13 million from his professional career in China.</p><p>But he allegedly showed no earnings, due to which the state of Kentucky lost revenue worth around $400,000. Even the FBI special agents got involved in the case and had interrogated him via FaceTime.</p><p>Fortunately, the court in Lexington acquitted him of all charges after a long legal battle in September 2021.
