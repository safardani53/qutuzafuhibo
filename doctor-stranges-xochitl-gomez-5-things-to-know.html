The character was originally written for someone in their late teens, but a then 14-year-old Gomez decided to take a chance and send in an audition tape anyway. By her second reading, they had tweaked the role to open it up to a larger range of actresses.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I might have a shot at this!'” she recalled. “So I did some stunt training for a full month, every other day for a couple hours, and then I did the test. And two days later, I found out I was cast. It all went pretty quick!”</p><p>Though she has been acting since the age of 5, <a href=#>Doctor Strange was the biggest project</a> that Gomez has been a part of, and it took some time for her to process that she was playing a superhero. “My reaction was basically, ‘Oh, great, wow.’ Then of course, as I get off the call, I’m like, ‘Did that really just happen?'” she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in June 2021. “Of course, it took me probably two or three days until it actually hit.”</p><p>The You’re the Worst actress continued: “That’s when I actually, I cried. I mean, my mom didn’t know. I don’t want her to know, but I definitely, at night I cried. It’s just crazy that I get to be a part of this crazy, huge thing. It’s so just insane.”</p><p>Introduced in September 2011 before joining the Young Avengers in January 2013, <a href=#>America Chavez is a tough, wise-cracking teenager</a> with the ability to travel through multiple dimensions and powers that include superhuman strength, invulnerability, and the ability to explode her enemies into star fragments with a single punch. However, <a href=#>when fans meet her in Doctor Strange</a>, she’s just discovering her powers and learning about the multiverse. “It was very important for me to keep that youthful, fake-it-till-you-make-it kind of vibe,” Gomez told Entertainment Weekly in May 2022 about her approach to playing a 14-year-old America.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“In this movie, there’s a lot of heavy stuff going on. It’s not easy when you’re a teenager and you have all this pressure and crazy stuff going on around you,” she continued. “You have to remember that you are a kid. You’re allowed to make mistakes, and we’re all learning. … It was kind of fun <a href=#>taking the version from the comics</a> and making her younger and less experienced.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Gomez:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZvKTAzqtkrKyilruosdJmr6ibmJ7BrXnGqKSesl1qerW0yKeerGWkpHqsus6wZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
