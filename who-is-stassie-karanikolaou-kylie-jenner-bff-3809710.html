They met up an a L.A. Clippers game then headed to Hyde nightclub on Nov. 22,&nbsp; and now the pair was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>among a group</a> attending the Los Angeles Rams vs. Baltimore Ravens Monday Night Football game in L.A. on Nov. 25. Tyler, 26, and Stassie, 22, were joined by<strong> Kendall Jenner</strong> — pal of Tyler’s ex <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong> — as well as Bachelor Nation stars,&nbsp;<strong>Dylan Barbour</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Peter Weber</strong>, We’re got five things to know about Stassie.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. Stassie is of Greek descent, which explains her unusual last name.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>She’s of Greek heritage although she was born and raised in Los Angeles. She lives in Calabasas.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>2. Stassie became Kylie’s number one BFF after Jordyn Woods betrayed the Kar-Jenners.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While Stassie was always in the picture as part of Kylie’s inner circle — the girls have been friends since they were 11-years-old —&nbsp; she wasn’t Ky’s primary ride or die. That title belonged to <strong>Jordyn Woods</strong>, 22, until she fooled around with <strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong>‘s baby daddy and then-boyfriend <strong>Tristan Thompson</strong>, 28, at a house party in L.A. in February. Following the betrayal, Jordyn moved out of Kylie’s guest house and she was excommunicated from all things Kar-Jenner. Now Stassie is the main BFF in Kylie’s Instagram photos, tropical vacations, family events, and public outings. She was one of the lucky few who spent a week<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> yachting with Kylie</a> along Italy’s Amalfi Coast for her 22nd birthday celebration in August.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>3. Stassie is a model, Instagram Influencer and YouTube star.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>She has over 409K subscribers to her YT channel, where she shares vlogs on her many travels, makeup tutorials, cooking and beauty routines. Her Instagram account <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stassiebaby</a> has 6.4 million followers she frequently posts bikini and swimwear pics from her line with the Australian brand&nbsp; TJ SWIM. Stassie also models for <strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong>‘s denim line Good American.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>4. Stassie has big career plans.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>When asked in a Good American <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“squad” interview</a> where she sees herself in 5 years, Stassie responded, “In 5 years I’d like to see myself more prominent in the fashion and beauty world. I would love to do a lot more modeling and many more different campaigns. But most importantly I would love to help change the world we live in. I think we need a serious change for the better and I would love to be a part of a revolution that will accomplish that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>5. Stassie has been open about getting plastic surgery.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>She underwent a breast lift in 2017 after one of her breasts was a full cup size larger than the other. She told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harper’s Bazaar</a> at the time that, &nbsp;“I was very open to sharing—plastic surgery is nothing be ashamed of. A lot of people think plastic surgery is only for cosmetic reasons, to change something you’re insecure about. All my comments were saying, ‘you’re so insecure, you’re so insecure,’ which is the complete opposite. If I was insecure, I wouldn’t have showed it. I wanted to show people that there’s nothing to be ashamed of— that it’s so common for girls to have this issue and you can do something to fix it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LAta3SrKCeZZuWv6K6yKSmpZmfqnqsxcuinGailaO7pr6Mm52fZWNtfXqDkGlm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
