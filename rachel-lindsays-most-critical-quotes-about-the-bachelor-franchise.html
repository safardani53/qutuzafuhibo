The former Bachelorette has never been afraid to speak up about her issues with the Bachelor franchise.</p><p>The attorney first appeared on <a href=#><strong>Nick Viall</strong></a>’s season of The Bachelor in 2017. While she scored the first impression rose and made it to the final three, Viall ultimately picked <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Grimaldi</strong></a> over runner-up <a href=#><strong>Raven Gates</strong></a>. (Viall and Grimaldi split less than a year after the finale aired.)</p><p>Lindsay went on to be named the first African American lead as the season 13 Bachelorette.

I think it’s going to be harder for them to find relationships that work. … The show is either going to have to change or it’s gonna end.”</p><p>Scroll through for more of Rachel’s commentary on the franchise:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BnrqS0xKVkpaGemcCixdJmpKirpGKws7XTopqapF2mwrDAxKxkmpqfqsFuwMeeZJuZk52yrbvRZp2rmZ6Ytaq%2FxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
