Not only does the Pokémon consist of an adorable family of mice, but many are trying to collect both of its forms.</p><p>Maushold can be found in either a Family of Three or a Family of Four, but it's not easy to get either Pokémon.

Once you catch Tandemaus, you'll have to grind to evolve it to get Maushold.

Though there is no difference in stats between these two forms, any dedicated completionist will want to catch both versions. The Family of Four Maushold is incredibly common, so how do you get the Family of Three?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Unfortunately, there isn't a clear way to ensure that you're evolving your Tandemaus is evolving into a Family of Three. According to Bulbapedia, there's a one in 100 chance Tandemaus will evolve into a Family of Three Maushold, and that's pre-determined by its Encryption Constant. There is no way to check what the Pokémon's Encryption Constant is, so you'll have to continuously evolve Tandemaus until you manage to get a Family of Three.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGK6osHSoaalnF2lvKyxzKilZquTlr%2BtsdNmraKnnJrB</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
