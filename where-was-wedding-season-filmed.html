When her mother, Suneeta (Veena Sood), makes her a dating profile on the site DreamyDesiPartner without her permission, Asha agrees to meet "MIT genius" Ravi (Suraj Sharma) and attend weddings alongside him if Suneeta deletes the profile. Though Asha is a bit stubborn, she soon finds herself smitten with the "Indian Prince Charming."</p><p>Though the fake couple attends a slew of Indian weddings together, the movie doesn't take place in India.
