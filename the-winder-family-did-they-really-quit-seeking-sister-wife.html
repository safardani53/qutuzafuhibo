We didn’t appear on your TVs for fame or money. The show is called “Seeking Sister Wife,” and our seeking is incidental to our religious beliefs," the Winders wrote as a caption to a family photo.</p><p>"We weren’t on the show to find another wife.</p><p>"Being open to that blessing would have happened with or without the show."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It sure sounds like Colton and company are walking away, doesn’t it?</p><p>They continued:</p><p>"The reasons we agreed to appear on television were twofold. First, we wanted to give the world a genuine portrayal of plural marriage in our faith, with all of its beauty and struggle.</p><p>"Second, we wanted to legitimize our voices in fighting to change the laws in Utah so that families like ours wouldn’t have to live in fear and secrecy anymore."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Fair enough, right?</p><p>"We don’t know for sure that we were successful in either of those, but after we had started filming our second season, the law in Utah changed, and we portrayed our joys and struggles on the show and our social media as genuinely as we can," they added.</p><p>"This lifestyle can be hard, and we never wanted to paint it any other way."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Winders then explained what transpired with their attempt to expand:</p><p>"In the end, Kimberley didn’t join our family.
