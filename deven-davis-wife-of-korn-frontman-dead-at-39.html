Jonathan Davis, was found dead on Friday.</p><p>She was 39 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The details surrounding Deven’s passing, along with her marriage to Jonathan, are both confusing and tragic.</p><p>The artist actually filed for, and was granted, a restraining order against Deven just hours before she died.</p><p>It prohibited Deven from having any contact with the family dog and also from seeing the two kids she shared with Jonathan.</p><p>However, for those wondering whether Deven took her own life or if her passing was in any way related to this legal ruling, the answer is no: <a href=#>TMZ sources say</a> she had not been served prior to her death.</p><p>In his court documents, Jonathan alleged that Deven suffered from a serious drug problem and that she had unsuccessfully be battling it for more than two decades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/jonathan-davis-872x1024.jpg><p>The Korn frontman says this heavy drug use caused Deven to neglate her kids.</p><p>He wrote in his court declaration that she has been dependent on both prescription and illegal narcotics over the years.</p><p>He also said had been to rehab six times and "is constantly under the influence of the nitrous oxide, cocaine and Norco."</p><p>It gets even more grisly, however.</p><p>The singer went into extreme detail when it came to these allegations against his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/korn-singer-865x1024.jpg><p>Jonathan went on to claim that Deven had a drug dealer boyfriend … who was recently passed out on her living room couch when he brought the children to her house.</p><p>The artist also says he found a heroin pipe and cocaine floating in the toilet bowl and found Deven passed out on the floor upstairs.</p><p><strong>Yikes</strong>.</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;Jonathan claims when Deven went on a major drug binge that she would "routinely bring home unsavory characters, including strangers…</p><p>"Some of these people are random fans of my music who she allows to come into the house, go into the master bedroom closet and try on my clothes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/davis-743x1024.jpg><p>According to the documents, Deven had been in a sober home but went missing last Friday and hadn’t been seen for a week</p><p>The couple split in 2016, but were still legally married.</p><p>No cause of death has been announced as of this writing.</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:&nbsp;"The Davis family is brokenhearted over the devastating loss of Deven Davis," a representative for Jonathan said in a statement to Blabbermouth, adding:</p><p>"We ask that you respect their privacy — and the privacy of those close to the family — and allow them the space to mourn in private.</p><p>"We thank you for your love, understanding and prayers of support during this difficult time."</p><ul
