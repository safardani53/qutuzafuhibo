I’ve started trying it on already.&nbsp;</p><p>“Are you joking me? I look f***ing phenomenal. I look insane.”</p><p>The waist tie around the dress, however, was a confusing feature for Ash.</p><p>She joked: “I don’t really know what this is, I thought it was a scarf in case you get cold when you’re waiting for your kebab.”</p><p>She got the stunning sparkly dress in two colours, and after trying on the second one, she’d come up with a theory on what the dangly belt was for.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “Ok, I’ve tried it on in this colour now and I’ve decided that it must be something to keep your labia warm because it’s a very short dress and I’m going to get frostbite.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“Tuck it up the back, you’ve got something to keep the old flappa-lappas warm.”</p><p>Despite her jokes about the dress’s belt, she still said the dress was “beautiful”.</p><p>Ash then showed off a flowy red dress from the collection.</p><p>She said: “Oh my god, how beautiful are these clothes? Look! I’m like a flamenco emoji.”</p><p>The video racked up 1.5 million views and commenters agreed the new collection looked incredible on Ash.&nbsp;</p><p>“NAH YOU ARE UNREAL”, wrote one viewer, while a second said: “That red dress is amazing on you! Your videos are the best and you always make me giggle.”</p><p>“Okay I need that green sequin dress”, commented a third.</p><p>“You look amazing in all”, a fourth wrote, while another said: “Wow that first dress is incredible on you!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/31387be5-8a12-48f0-9363-87d4a4bc1ebd.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6afbb034-528e-48b0-ac62-dc0cb6b294cc-1.jpg><p>For more fashion stories, this shopper went crazy on PLT - 'I got&nbsp;<a href=#>£2k worth of PrettyLittleThing clothes for £21</a>&nbsp;in the sales – I don’t even want half of it but I can’t help myself'.</p><p>Plus, this shopper demands&nbsp;<a href=#>apology from Molly Mae Hague</a>&nbsp;after ordering PLT jumper & being stunned by what turned up.</p><p>Also, a woman was left&nbsp;<a href=#>raging after allegedly receiving one shoe from her shopping order</a>.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Woman shocked to find ‘dirty pair of knickers’ stuffed in new jeans she ordered online</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BwZ25wZmiCcLbAnGSjp6Oorm66xLBkpaGemnqzrdWipaBln6OybsDHoqWgZaOpwq68xJ1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
