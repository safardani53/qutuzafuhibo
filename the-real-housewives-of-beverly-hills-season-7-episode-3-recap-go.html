Lisa’s business in New York appeared to stem from her other daughter, Delilah’s attempts to make a modeling career for herself.&nbsp;</p><p>Kyle Richards was also in New York, preparing to open a store. She had her daughter, Sophia with her. Lisa R decided to stop by Kyle’s store and it was far from complete.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, you’d never believe it was ever going to be a store. It looked like trash. Lisa R revealed to Kyle that she was trying her best to mend fences with Lisa Vanderpump.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She was tired of the animosity between the group. Kyle seemed to think this was a great idea, before Lisa R disappeared to meet someone about Delilah’s modeling career.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Lisa V was trying to find a gift for Ken. Normally, all Ken seems to receive are gifts for the dog, but it seemed like Lisa V wanted to go for something different this time round.&nbsp;</p><p>Dorit Kemsley accompanied the SUR boss, who inevitably settled on giving her husband a watch for his birthday. Ken seemed shocked at it, but was happy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When Dorit returned home, she revealed that she was having some struggles with motherhood and relied heavily on the nannies to help her with the kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Dorit tried to take the kids to the park, but when one of them went crazy in the car, she decided it was best to just stay home with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, most of the group attended a white party at Pump.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Real Housewives All Stars: Who Should Be Cast?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Kyle was quick to start things off by making it clear she was better than everyone else.&nbsp;</p><p>She told them she had booked Alicia Silverstone for a project about her own upbringing. Yeah, because you just had to reveal that at that moment, Kyle.&nbsp;</p><p>Erika then spoke about her nerves about appearing on Eileen’s show because she was nervous about what to expect. Lisa revealed she tried to get a part on it, but was not successful.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The group then started making comments about Lisa’s age. She did not take it in bad taste, but Erika seemed pretty pissed that Lisa chimed in.&nbsp;</p><p>"Let’s get fake British accents and start insulting people!"</p><p>That was not the end of the argument, either, but the rest of it seemed to focus on Erika’s lack of underwear. It was difficult to make sense of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, they’re all still friends.&nbsp;</p><p>What did you think of all the drama?</p><p>Sound off below!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>19 Real Housewives Who Only Lasted One Season</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2puX2Z%2FcMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmmZ6ulae5unnHoqOlq12osqK%2FzqdkcGWVpba0u8OeZGxlopqworyMoKZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
