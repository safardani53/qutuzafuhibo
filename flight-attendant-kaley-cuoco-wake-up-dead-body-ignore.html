The fact that she acting like she ain’t know she woke up to this man dead!"</p><p>Another added: "You take a guy back to your hotel room, have fun, wake up and the man is dead. Throat slit. Blood all over. Your next move is to…….clean up the hotel room????"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000623631199.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000615618917-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000623829711.jpg><p>A third then mused: "I don't know how I would have reacted to a dead body, but I want to believe I would have handled it better than Cassie."</p><p>One then posted: "Wait, so she literally just gone leave a dead body in the hotel and go to work."</p><p>Another clearly gripped viewer then surmised: "Any show that begins with someone waking up from a drunken night laying next to a dead body and they don't know what happens. I'm in."</p><p>Meanwhile, Kaley, 34, previously told how she had to take down a few notes from her on-screen lover Michiel Huisman to make her first on screen sex scene look more believable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000619501979.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000622123502.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Drama</h2></p><p>Kaley is most well known for her role as Penny&nbsp;on the popular&nbsp;CBS&nbsp;sitcom&nbsp;The Big Bang Theory&nbsp;- which rarely got to see her get down on dirty on screen like in&nbsp;The Flight Attendant.</p><p>The star certainly had to turn the temperature up a notch whilst filming a sex scene with Michiel - who plays the stewardess' love interest Alex Sokolov - in a plane toilet.</p><p>When the time came for the big scene and she wasn't really giving it her all, The Big Bang Theory star told: "Michiel finally goes, 'It looks like you’re hovering over a public toilet. What are you doing?'</p><p>"I’m like, 'I don’t know what I’m doing'.
