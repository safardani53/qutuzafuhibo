Please remember to be respectful and kind to one another. Be well be kind.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In June 2020, Eliza explained how she and Bob <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fell in love</a>. They had been friends for years while on The 100, but their relationship changed in 2019. When Eliza and her roommate were moving into an apartment, Bob came over to help and asked Eliza out on a date. “Honestly, it was as if someone had switched on a light, and we were truly seeing each other for the first time,” she wrote. They later returned to their home country of Australia and got engaged in April 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“We wanted all the same things,” Eliza continued. “To live in the countryside, to have kids, to still pursue our dreams in LA while having a strong home base in Australia. And just as easily as that conversation came, so did the proposal. We said, ‘We want this life, we want it together, so let’s not waste any more time and get married.’ One month later, we were wed on a mountain top in Hawaii. We weren’t trying to break the internet, we weren’t trying to hurt our ex-partners, we were in love. Plain and simple.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5ByZp6kma%2BubsDAsqOoql2XrqPFjJumm2WdpL%2BtsdhmnaKqo6l6pLTIpZtmqJikwbB7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
