Daddy will always love you,” the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> alum, 35, captioned a Thursday, November 10, Instagram photo of Dream — whom he shares with his former fiancée, <a href=#><strong>Blac Chyna</strong></a> — grinning inside a giant dinosaur egg replica.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Rob-Kardashian-Celebrates-Daughter-Dreams-Birthday-185.jpg><p>The <a href=#>proud dad</a> also shared a snap of his only daughter eating toast with sprinkles via his Instagram Story. In a subsequent Story, the California native showed off <a href=#>a series of giant balloons</a> that spelled out, “Happy Birthday Dream.”</p><p>The USC alum and Chyna, 34, who <a href=#>were engaged from April to December of 2016</a> and share custody of their daughter, have had their ups and downs over the years. In March, the model claimed that she wasn’t receiving any financial support from Kardashian or <a href=#><strong>Tyga</strong></a>, with whom she <a href=#>shares 10-year-old son King</a>.</p><p>“Yesterday I had to give up 3 of my cars … my reasons … morals, beliefs, <a href=#>being a single mother, no support</a> I’m a MAMA,” she alleged via Twitter at the time. The Real Blac Chyna alum doubled down on the claims in a second social media post, writing that she was “single [with] no support [and no] child support.”</p><p>Kardashian denied the allegations while responding to The Shade Room’s Instagram coverage of the drama. “[I] pay 37k a year for my daughter’s school. I <a href=#>handle every single medical expense</a>. I pay for all her extracurricular activities,” the Arthur George founder wrote earlier this year.</p><p>Tyra, 32, also commented on the post, writing, “I pay 40k a year for my son school.”</p><p>Chyna has also had her problems with Kardashian’s family. In 2017, she sued <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner,</strong></a> <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> </a>for <a href=#>contract interference and defamation</a> after her reality show Rob & Chyna was put on hold. The trial began in April, with all four Kardashian-Jenner women named in the suit taking the stand.</p><p>Rob also testified, telling the judge he was “very vulnerable” during his relationship with the Lashed By Blac Chyna founder, and therefore “[ignored] <a href=#>her bad behavior toward” his family</a>.</p><p>“I was <a href=#>probably at the worst place in my entire life</a>, at my weakest, lowest point. She was the one person who brought me in at my lowest point,” he claimed. “I wasn’t thinking about that stuff. My mind was just in a completely different place. It wasn’t real love.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In May, <a href=#>a judge ruled to dismiss the case</a> and Chyna was not awarded any damages. The sole Kardashian brother previously dismissed a lawsuit of his own against his ex-fiancée.</p><p>“My love for Dream far outweighs my desire to proceed with my claims against her mother in a public trial,” the reality TV veteran said in a February statement to E! News after <a href=#>dropping his assault and battery lawsuit</a> against Chyna.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarp5JiuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3qkscuemauZpJrAbrDArp6hrJWneqW%2BxJqkrGVmqbVursirq6Gcka58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
