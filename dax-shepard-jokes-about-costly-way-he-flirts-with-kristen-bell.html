So it’s costly, but I think it’s worth it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dax-Shepard-Reveals-How-He-Flirts-With-Kristen-Bell.jpg><p>During <a href=#>quarantine</a>, the couple, who tied the knot in October 2013, have not been able to enjoy the usual activities they love in the summer, but they found a nice substitute. “I think I’m in [the] only show in Hollywood that’s actually in production, so I’m shooting out&nbsp;Top Gear America, which involves a lot of travel, so right now we’re on like day 13 of having been all over the Southwest, all by car. We’re not flying anywhere, and we rented a house in Sedona, and we brought the family we’ve been quarantined with. We brought a ton of Planet Oat ice cream,” he shared. “My wife and I are both addicted to the chocolate peanut butter. They’ve been just kind of floating around with me as I shoot&nbsp;Top Gear, and I <a href=#>get tested every other day</a> on set. It’s definitely a new version of this, but it’s going pretty good and they’re having a blast, and yeah, we’re doing OK. We’re kind of thriving in this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Plant-Ice-cream.jpg><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Shepard spoke out against the <a href=#>criticism Bell, 39, gets when it comes to parenting</a> their daughters, Lincoln, 7, and Delta, 5. “Shaming traps in general are pretty misogynistic and aimed largely at women,” he said. “<a href=#>Kristen will get attacked</a> long before I will even though we’re both equally in the mix. I am against any version of shaming, whether it starts with ‘How long did you breast-feed?’ ‘Did you give birth in the woods?’ ‘Did you do this?’ ‘Are you doing that?’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The&nbsp;Parenthood&nbsp;alum added that he is somewhat “sympathetic” to social media trolls because he doesn’t believe their intentions are malicious. “Most people want their kids to thrive in all the ways,” he explained. “They want them to be healthy, they want them to have opportunities, they want all that. That’s what we all have in common.”</p><p>With reporting by Carly Sloane</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmahiwKmxz5qpnWWapLimv4yamaitpGKwsL%2FTpbBmr5GueqmxjJ%2BjoqqkqHq4tdOhZKSqmajBprqMm5ylpF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
