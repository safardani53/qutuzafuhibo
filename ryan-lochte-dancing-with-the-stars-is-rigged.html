world’s most lovable dumbass, Ryan Lochte.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ryan-lochte-finishes-dancing.jpg><p>Shortly after he was caught lying about being <a href=#>robbed at gunpoint at the Rio Olympics</a>, Lochte made an unexpected career choice that’s done little to help mend his battered reputation.</p><p>When rumors first began to circulate&nbsp;that <a href=#>Lochte&nbsp;would join the cast of Dancing With the Stars</a> for the show’s 23rd season, many took it as a joke.</p><p>Then the&nbsp;cast was officially announced, and Lochte confirmed that yet again, what seemed to ridiculous to be true was in fact a serious life decision that he made, presumably after careful consideration.</p><p>Now, Lochte is proving his critics right and demonstrating that like the Little Mermaid and so many millions of hooked fish before him, Ryan was really better off in the water.</p><p>On his very first episode, <a href=#>Lochte was rushed by protesters</a>, who are now facing jail time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>That’s hardly Lochte’s fault, but it’s the kind of idiocy you invite when you decide to weather the storm of an international scandal by doing competitive cha-cha’s&nbsp;on ABC.</p><p>Anyway, it turns out Lochte is only slightly&nbsp;better at dancing than he is at lying his way out of tight spots.</p><p>On tonight’s elimination show, he and Cheryl Burke are on the chopping block along with several other couples who all failed to earn immunity during<a href=#> last night’s competition</a>.</p><p>Marilu Henner and Derek Hough, Amber Rose and Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds and Allison Holker,&nbsp;or&nbsp;Terra Jolé and Sasha Farber could all be sent packing.</p><p>Of course, a bad attitude is often a deal-breaker on DWTS and thus far, two stars have allegedly been caught speaking ill about their show and their experiences in the race for the Mirrored Ball.</p><p>Last week, sources claimed that <a href=#>Amber Rose griped that the show is "rigged."</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ryan-lochte-on-dancing-with-the-stars.jpg><p>Now, it seems <a href=#>Lochte is echoing her complaint</a>.</p><p>According to Radar Online, the Olympian is not happy about facing elimination, and he feels that the judges knew he would never win the competition before he ever set foot on the floor.</p><p>“Ryan and Cheryl are pretty sure that they are going to be eliminated tonight," a source tells the website.</p><p>“Ryan was actually telling people that he thought the show was rigged and that everyone was out to sabotage him."</p><p>The 32-year-old also took issue with last night’s unorthodox head-to-head format:</p><p>“He also said that it was unfair of them to put him and Cheryl up against James Hinchcliffe and his partner Sharna Burgess, because he said that they are both ‘really strong dancers.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/ryan-lochte-foxtrots.png><p>The insider adds that Lochte was visibly upset after Hinchcliffe and Burgess emerged victorious:</p><p>“After they lost last night, Ryan was not even trying to hide his emotions," the source says.</p><p>"He was super upset and Cheryl was trying to console him, but he was not having any of it.”</p><p>So could Lochte be facing yet another public humiliation?</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>16 Things Ryan Lochte Definitely Would Do</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW
