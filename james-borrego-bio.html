It seems like the 43-year-old has managed to keep his early years private.</p><p>Nonetheless, we found out that Borrego attended Albuquerque Academy and then enrolled at the University of San Diego.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giovanni Reyna Bio: England, Career, Father, Age, Salary, Net Worth Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Furthermore, during his time in San Diego, Borrego played on the college basketball team as a forward. The 42-year-old was even named to the West Coast Conference All-Academic Team.</p><h2>James Borrego: Career</h2><p>Although Borrego was a good player during his college years, deep down inside, James knew he was not good enough to play in the NBA. Thus, the New Mexico native decided to take his talents to the coaching department of basketball.</p><p>In his first job, James took the assistant coach’s role with his alma mater, the University of San Diego, from 2001 to 2003. Furthermore, the 43-year-old had some memorable moments with San Diego Toreros during his three-year stay.</p><p>The team won the West Coast Conference Championship and consequently earned a trip to the prestigious NCCA tournament in the 2002-03 season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/borrego-967.jpg><p>Following his impressive tenure with the Toreros, Borrego got the opportunity of his life as he got the chance to work under one of the greatest coaches in basketball history, <strong>Greg Popovich</strong>.</p><p>Although James started as an assistant video coordinator, he quickly gained Popovich’s trust and earned a promotion to assistant coach.</p><p>After that, the New Mexico native stayed with the San Antonio Spurs for seven years, winning two championships in 2005 and 2007.</p><p>However, at the end of the 2009-10 campaign, James decided that a change in the surrounding was needed.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob McKenzie Bio: Career, Twitter, Salary, Net Worth, Wife, Kids Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Hence, Borrego&nbsp;decided to move to the New Orleans Hornets (now New Orleans Pelicans), and Spurs’ assistant <strong>Monty Williams</strong> took the head coach role.</p><p>Subsequently, the duo’s stay together lasted only two years as James decided to leave the job in 2012.</p><p>At that time, the reason for his departure was not made public. However, it later turned out that Borrega had been offered the lead assistant job at Orlando Magic.</p><p>Subsequently, he&nbsp;took the job and, after a while, got the most significant break of his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/borrego-966.jpg><p>Call it fate or call it a chance, James got the opportunity to become the head coach of Orlando Magic, albeit for a short period of time when then-head coach <strong>James Vaugh</strong> got fired.</p><p>Nonetheless, the New Mexico native won his first game against the world-renowned Los Angeles Lakers. Thereafter, Borrega guided the team to a respectable finish and left at the end of the season.</p><p>Soon after leaving, it was announced that James had signed with San Antonio Spurs as their assistant coach.</p><p>Subsequently, the 42-year-old relished the chance to work with his first mentor in NBA, Popovich, with whom he learned a lot.</p><p>After that, he enjoyed three relatively successful years with the Spurs, but Borrego was never really satisfied as he wanted to be the man calling all the shots.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Damian Lillard Bio: Career, Stats, Contract, Endorsements Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Then, on May 10, 2018, James got the ultimate job he had worked for 15 long years, the Charlotte Hornets head coach.</p><p>Added to that, the contract was a four-year deal, unlike his last stint with the Magic. Thus, upon signing with the Hornets, James also became the first Latino head coach in the NBA’s 72-year-long history.</p><p>Subsequently, in his first year with the Hornets, Borrego nearly managed to take them to the playoffs.</p><p>Furthermore, the Charlotte-based franchise only missed the playoff spot by two games. Nevertheless, there were many good moments for Borrego&nbsp;and Charlotte Hornets to take into the next season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/borrego-965.jpeg><p>Talking about his current 2019-20 season, the Hornets sit in the 10th spot in the Eastern Conference standings. However, due to the world pandemic of Corona Virus (COVID-19), the NBA has been postponed until further notice.</p><p>In conclusion, we would like to wish the Charlotte Hornets franchise good health and hope they stay virus-free.</p><p>Furthermore, whenever NBA resumes, we have full confidence that James will lead his team to better performances than pre-virus.</p><h2>James Borrego: Lamelo Ball and Michael Jordan&nbsp;</h2><p>Borrego has been a while part of the team. As a coach, he has flourished himself and also helps Lamelo Ball to thrive on his own. Also, working under Michael Jordan, he has been packed full of energy.&nbsp;</p><p>As per him, Lamelo has been doing great in his rehabilitation process ever since his surgery not so long ago.</p><p>Indeed, his wrist injury bought a set of disappointment; however, James has been all concerned with him intending to make him a strong player.&nbsp;</p><p>As a worker alongside Michael Jordan, he takes him as his internal drive. Moreover, he understands the hard work and effort put into it.&nbsp;</p><h2>James Borrego: Age, Height & Nationality</h2><p>Having been born in the year 1977 makes James 43 years old currently. Likewise, Borrego&nbsp;was born on November 12, which makes his horoscope Scorpio. Moreover, Borrego was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which makes him American by nationality.</p><p>Furthermore, James stands at 6 feet 5 inches (1.98 meters), making him stand out from most other coaches.</p><p>As a result, the New Mexico native is also one of the most well-known figures in the game. Besides, Borrego used his height during his college days, playing as a forward for the San Diego Toreros.</p><h2>James Borrego: Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>As of 2021, Borrego has a net worth of <strong>$3 million</strong> accrued mainly through his NBA coaching career. Likewise, he&nbsp;has been involved in the NBA for almost 17 years.

Since then, he&nbsp;has somewhat stopped the decline of the franchise.</p><h2>James Borrego: Wife & Kids</h2><p>James Borrego is happily married to his wife, <strong>Megan Borrego</strong>, with the couple being blessed with three children.</p><p>But we could not find the exact date of the pair’s wedding day.
