The most recent installment of the program is titled Autopsy: Eddie Van Halen’s Last Hours. The program will premiere on Reelz on June 5th (Sunday), 2022, at 8 PM ET.</p><p>The forthcoming episode gained attention and generated a buzz when the rockstar’s son Wolfgang Van Halen harshly attacked the show upcoming episode. He is said to have said,</p><p>“Heartless and Pathetic.”</p><p>According to Reelz’s official description for the June 5th episode of Autopsy:</p><p>“By the age of 25, Eddie’s band had sold numerous platinum records, and his inventive guitar methods had established Eddie’s place in Rock and Roll history.” Nothing seemed to be able to stop him. But there was a darker undertone lurking beyond Eddie’s captivating grin, one that would haunt him for the rest of his life. He struggled with addiction for nearly four decades, having begun drinking at the age of 12. Eddie spent several years in and out of rehab, sometimes depending on booze and other medications to preserve his inventiveness. He was a workaholic, often straining his body to its limits to perform while covertly suffering from disease. Eddie died of cancer at the age of 65. Eddie’s sickness, on the other hand, had a good survival percentage if discovered early. So, what exactly happened? Dr. Michael&nbsp; Hunter, a world-renowned forensic pathologist, must examine every element of Eddie Van Halen’s life in order to put together what else may have been going on in his body, eventually leading to his tragic death.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Eddie-Van-Halen-3.jpg alt="Eddie Van Halen" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Without further ado, let’s go into the past to discover what happened to renowned rocker Eddie Van Halen before the next episode premieres on Reelz.</p><h2>Eddie Van Halen’s tragic death</h2><p>Eddie Van Halen is without a doubt one of the greatest rock performers of all time.
