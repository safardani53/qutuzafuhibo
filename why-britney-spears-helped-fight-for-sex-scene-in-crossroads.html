Along the way, Spears’ Lucy connected with Ben, who was driving the girls for the duration of the journey. <a href=#>Their sex scene</a>, which appears toward the end of the film, was done “tastefully” according to Davis. (The movie is rated PG-13.)</p><p class=p3>“A kid would not know what the heck is going on!” Davis, 61, quipped to <i>EW</i>. “That was a fight I’m happy we won.”</p><p class=p3>Prior to <i>Crossroads</i>, Spears had <a href=#>made a name as a pop star</a> and for her relationship with ‘NSync singer<a href=#><strong> Justin Timberlake</strong></a>. The pair dated between 1999 and 2002 before <a href=#>splitting over infidelity rumors</a>. Upon their breakup, Timberlake, 42, infamously hinted that <a href=#>he knew that Spears was not a virgin</a> despite her public image during an interview with Barbara Walters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/why-britney-spears-helped-fight-for-sex-scene-in-crossroads-01.jpg><p>Back in 2003, Spears told W magazine that she <a href=#>had only slept with “one person my whole life,”</a> insinuating that it was Timberlake.</p><p class=p3><i>Us Weekly </i>confirmed earlier this month that<a href=#> Spears reveals in her <i>The Woman in Me </i>memoir</a> who she lost her virginity to — and it was not Timberlake. According to her book, she had sex for the first time with the childhood best friend of her brother, <a href=#><strong>Bryan Spears</strong></a>. (Timberlake has not addressed her memoir claims, though a source told <i>Us </i>that <a href=#>he’s “trying to distance himself”</a> from the tell-all.)</p><p class=p3>Britney <a href=#>was dating Timberlake</a> when she filmed <i>Crossroads.</i></p><p class=p3><i>“</i>I would have to go knock on her hotel room door in the morning sometimes and be like, ‘OK, Britney, time to go,’ and Justin would be there,” Davis recalled to <i>EW</i>. “It was during the height of, ‘Is Britney a virgin?’ I wasn’t even going to ask! Even waking her up in the hotel room, I was like, whatever is going on in your private life, that’s private.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/why-britney-spears-helped-fight-for-sex-scene-in-crossroads-02.jpg><p class=p3>Davis — who thought the Grammy winners were the “cutest couple” at the time — even added a brief<a href=#> ‘NSync</a> reference in the film. Lucy and her besties notably belted out <a href=#>the band’s “Bye Bye Bye”</a> when they drove Ben’s car away from a gas station as he took a nap in the backseat.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>“The scene encapsulated what was going on with the music scene at that time,” Davis explained on Friday. “It was this mixture of what music [Ben] wanted to listen to, which was Nirvana and alt-grunge, versus what the girls wanted to listen to, which was <a href=#>‘NSync and Backstreet Boys and boy bands</a>. We loved that contrast of radio. I don’t know if it was specifically in the script. I think up to the last minute, we didn’t know if we would have the rights because it was a gigantic song.”</p><p class=p3><i>Crossroads </i>returns to theaters nationwide on Monday, October 23, and Wednesday, October 25.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hsV2Xv6rAzZ6wZqugmq6zv4yhnKWolZl6p7XGoatmnp%2BnerSx12aqnJ2emnqquoycqairo6e8orDSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
