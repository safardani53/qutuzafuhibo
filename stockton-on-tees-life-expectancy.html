Having been told he has just six months to live because of chronic lung condition emphysema, he's making preparations so that his two young children don't have to sit through a ceremony that lasts longer than half an hour.</p><p>But he's far from the only person in Stockton-on-Tees contemplating his mortality - in his postcode, men will die 20 years earlier than in a town just five miles away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ROB-MEL-HARVEY-LOW-ANGLE-MASK.jpeg><p>In contrast, <a href=#>the UK national life expectancy</a> for a man is 79, and 82 for women.</p><p>In Yarm, a more affluent area just a few miles away where houses cost an average of £285,000, people can expect to live well into their 80s.</p><p>But how is it that your postcode can knock off so many years from your life expectancy?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GL-COMPOSITE-Teeside-map-V3.jpg><p>Stockton-on-Tees, where Rob lives, is a deprived market town in the North East, with house prices averaging £130,000.</p><p>It is also home to <a href=#>the biggest health gap in the UK</a>.</p><p>Tonight he is one of the people behind the life expectancy statistics profiled on a new BBC documentary, Panorama: Get Rich or Die Young.</p><p>The doc, presented by journalist Richard Bilton, explores the stark link between poverty and an early grave.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423779906.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423779904.jpg><h2>The real stories behind the statistics</h2><p>Rob, an overweight smoker admits his health problems are down to his poor lifestyle choices, saying starting <a href=#>smoking was "the worst decision" he has ever made</a>.</p><p>"I could go to sleep tonight, and it's just gone, lights out," he says, fearful of the lung disease that causes shortness of breath. "It's the last thing I want my kids to see."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/capture141.png><p>Prior to becoming a cabbie, he had a healthy diet, but due to his job he began to rely on fast food on-the-go - leading to the weight piling on and his health issues.</p><p>As he frankly discusses his cremation with a funeral planner, his young kids Harvey and Mel discuss the impact of their dad's terminal diagnoses.</p><p>"Dad is the best," says his son Harvey. "He's not gone yet...but no-one ever knows when he's going to be gone."</p><p>"I can see the effect it [my diagnosis] has on my partner and children," says Rob. "I don't like thinking about it, but... I know what's coming for me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Capture171-e1532947543896.png><p>Nicotine isn't the only drug blighting the health of residents of Stockton-on-Tees.</p><p>We also meet 58-year-old grandmother Ingrid, whose 31-year-old daughter Amy has been forced to give up her newborn baby for adoption due to her crack cocaine addiction.</p><p>Ingrid, who has physical and mental health problems that are exacerbated by the stress of her daughter's addiction, has also formally adopted Amy's other kids Marni and Rico - but heartbreakingly is unable to do the same for her third grandchild.</p><p>Amy is trying to get clean but still disappears for the night and goes to a crack den, prompting Ingrid to chuck her out of the family home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/capture210-e1532948139202.png><p>Amy, who has lost everything due to drugs, knows she will die if she carries on.</p><p>"More than likely, I will die young," she tells Richard. "I expect that, it's just part and parcel of it all."</p><p>Every four weeks, somebody dies due to drugs in the town.</p><p>Drug deaths have more than doubled in Stockton-on-Tees since 2001, with experts saying that this is&nbsp;due to high unemployment levels, boredom and people in poorer areas looking to boost their income through dealing.</p><p>Deprivation also often means a user is less likely to get care and treatment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/capture42-e1532949354372.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/capture122-e1532949262512.png><p>And Ingrid expresses fears that she too will die young from the stress of her coping with her daughter's addiction.</p><p>Suicide, too, is twice as common in deprived than richer areas, as the pressures of living below the breadline can take their toll on mental health.</p><p>In the programme we meet Yvonne, who has battled depression and anxiety, and has tried to kill herself several times.</p><p>Unable to work, she can't afford private counselling, and due to budget cuts, the mental health centre she relied on has been closed - leaving her with nowhere to go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423779918.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423780076.jpg><h2>Dying of poverty</h2><p>Experts say that poverty is directly to blame for the low life expectancy in the area, fuelling poor mental health, drug and alcohol dependency and obesity.</p><p>Prof Clare Bambra, from Newcastle University, led a five-year study into health inequality in Stockton-on-Tees.</p><p>"The poor are dying younger because they have less money in order to live a healthy life. They have more pressures on them, they have more insecurity and they have less control over their life," she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/capture110.png><p>Dr David Hodges works at the GP practice in the centre of town.</p><p>He says many of the patients he sees have "preventable" diseases, such as cancers caused by smoking or obesity-related illnesses such as heart disease and type-2 diabetes, something that needs fixing.</p><p>"People have the right to get to retirement age healthy," he says. "I don't accept as a society that we should be expecting people to be unwell in their 40s."<br></p><h2>Heading for an early grave</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/capture72.png><p>Nothing shows the scale of the life expectancy problem in Stockton-on-Tees more than the town's cemetery.</p><p>As presenter Richard walks through, he's stunned to see so many people have died in their 30s and 40s.</p><p>"The health inequality is written on these gravestones," he says.</p><p>"The ages are shocking - this place is full of people who have died too young. It makes 60 seem like a big age to die when it's no age at all."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/capture82-e1532948701105.png><h2>The future of the town</h2><p>It's clear something needs to change - and fast - before more people die young from preventable illnesses.</p><p>Leading the way is primary school headmistress&nbsp;Bernie Rizzi-Allan, who has introduced health therapies and counselling to help the local kids - with amazing results. She claims that within her school, children from less wealthy areas are out performing those from affluent backgrounds.</p><p>It's thought kids from deprived backgrounds fall behind early on, something Bernie wants to change.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/capture101.png><p>"People's health should not be defined by their social class," says Bernie.</p><p>"Our children have got just as much of an innate ability, potential and talent.</p><p>"If we don't recognise that, we're losing this resource. The country is losing so much potential."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in news</h2></p><p>The government has previously stated that it is committed to helping address the wealth inequality - however the unfairness is laid bare when you look at the situation in Stockton-on-Tees.</p><p>As local undertaker Alison tells Richard: "You look, and you see somebody's age and you think that that's far too young - it reaches out into all the years that follow."</p><p><strong>Panorama: Get Rich or Die Young&nbsp;is on BBC One tonight, 8.30 pm</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfa4V6gZJtaGirpKSwrMDOp2Sopl2psqa%2FjKWgn51dmsWxscKtmKebqWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
