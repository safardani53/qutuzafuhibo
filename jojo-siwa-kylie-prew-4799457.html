The two first met while on a cruise ship in Dec. 2019 and became fast friends. JoJo and Kylie opened up about their first meeting during an Aug. 2021 interview on the&nbsp;Success With Jess podcast. JoJo said that she instantly felt connected to Kylie and came out to her “within 10 minutes” of meeting. At the time, she had not publicly come out as a member of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/JoJo-Siwa-Kylie-Prew-backgrid-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>When Siwa and Prew met on the cruise ship, Kylie had a boyfriend, but JoJo said she knew that her new friend was gay. Six months later, Kylie came out as bisexual to JoJo, and eventually they started dating each other.</p><h2>When Did JoJo Siwa & Kylie Prew Become Official?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>JoJo first publicly came out as gay in mid-Jan. 2021. Shortly after making the announcement, she revealed that she had a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>secret girlfriend</a>. During an interview with <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong>, the former Dance Moms alum explained that it was her girlfriend who had encouraged her to come out. JoJo did not reveal Kylie’s identity, though, until the pair’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>one-month anniversary</a> on Feb. 8, 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“After being my best friend for over a year, [on] January 8, 2021 I got to start calling this exceptional human my girlfriend,” JoJo gushed. “Since then I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been! She is seriously the most loving, supportive, happiest, protective and most beautiful perfect person in the world. And I get to call her mine!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>During the Aug. 2021 podcast interview, JoJo explained how she finally asked Kylie out after more than a year of friendship. “I had a whole musical number,” the Dancing With The Stars vet said. “I had, like, word choreography that coordinated to music and then it went into a song. It was magical.” In a Sept. 2021 interview, though, JoJo revealed that Kylie actually asked&nbsp;her out first on Jan. 8, and JoJo followed that up with her own ask.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>When JoJo and Kylie first got together, they were in a long distance relationship, with Kylie living in Florida and JoJo in Los Angeles. In April 2021, JoJo even posted a photo of herself crying on Instagram after having to say goodbye to her girlfriend. “I just have to clarify, nothing happened, we just are long distance and had to say goodbye today and I am sad,” JoJo admitted. “It happens every time we have to say goodbye and I wish we didn’t have to ever, but we do and it just makes when we get to say hi to each other even more special.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/JoJo-Siwa-Kylie-Prew-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>However, at the time, they were able to make it work. Also during that same month, JoJo appeared at the GLAAD Media Awards, where she referenced her relationship with Kylie onstage. “I recently came out as part of the LGBTQ+ community,” JoJo said onstage. “I have the best, most amazing girlfriend in the world who makes me so, so happy and that’s all that matters.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>During Pride Month 2021, JoJo also gave Kylie a special shoutout on her Instagram. “It really has been the best five months of my life being exactly who I am and finding love has been the best part of it all,” JoJo gushed. “I love this human so much. I’m so happy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>On Sept. 5, 2021, JoJo and Kylie made their official red carpet debut at the premiere of JoJo’s movie&nbsp;The J Team. They looked so in love as they packed on the PDA at the event.</p><h2>JoJo Siwa & Kylie Prew’s Breakup</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>During the fall of 2021, JoJo made history as the first&nbsp;Dancing With the Stars contestant to team up with a same sex partner. She was partnered with&nbsp;<strong>Jenna Johnson&nbsp;</strong>on the show. When JoJo’s journey on the show first started, Kylie was extremely supportive, showing her love on social media ahead of the live shows and during rehearsals.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>However, by mid-October, things fell apart between JoJo and Kylie. Their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>breakup was confirmed</a> on Oct. 20, but fans had begun speculating that something had happened in the days leading up to that. “This week of my life has taught me SO much,” JoJo wrote on Instagram on Oct. 9. “Live in the moment. Smile however you can. Whatever it takes to be happy…do it. Even though this life has been one of the hardest of my life for so many different reasons, it’s also been one of the best.” JoJo also confirmed to&nbsp;UsWeekly at the time that she was dealing with something difficult in her personal life, but did not expand about the split.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>It wasn’t until a Nov. 2 appearance on&nbsp;<strong>Paris Hilton’s</strong> podcast,&nbsp;This Is Paris, that JoJo publicly confirmed the breakup herself. “I have yet to talk about this offically, publicly, but we broke up,” JoJo admitted. “But she is literally still my best friend. I talked to her yesterday. She just got a new puppy. She’s awesome.” She also added, “We’re both so young, she’s 17, I’m 18, and we are literally best friends. And I would take a bullet for her and I know she would for me. Literally right person, wrong time.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>JoJo attributed “hectic schedules” to the breakup. “I’m really happy that I remember all the fun times, all the good times, and nothing bad happened,” she admitted. “It just is the definition of a cheesy person saying, ‘Right person, wrong time,’ and I hate cheesy sayings, but they’re true.”</p><h2>JoJo Siwa & Kylie Prew Back Together Again</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>At the beginning of April 2021, JoJo appeared on the&nbsp;Rachel Uncensored podcast that she was no longer single. “We’re not single,” Siwa confirmed. “And I say ‘we’re’ because it’s me and my multiple personalities within myself. I am not single and I don’t want to mingle. I am a loyal lady.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/JoJo-Siwa-Kylie-Prew-mga-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-19>While she did not identify her mystery “exclusive” partner at the time, fans began speculating that she was back together with Kylie. During <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>another interview</a> at the end of the month, she continued to gush about her girlfriend, and promised to reveal her identity one day. She also confirmed that her relationship was still long distance at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Finally, at the beginning of May 2021, JoJo and Kylie seemingly confirmed their reconciliation by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>holding hands</a> during a trip to Disney World. JoJo then <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posted a photo</a> of them kissing during the trip on May 5. “If you love something, let it go, if it comes back…” she captioned the sweet image.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>JoJo then gushed about the relationship during an interview with&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight in mid-May. “I’m very happy and very lucky to be loved,” she said. “I think something that’s been so great is it’s been so honest. I think that’s a mistake I’ve made in the past, maybe trying to be something I wasn’t. But this is just so pure and so honest and it’s just so real and feels like I/we got it right.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>In June, the&nbsp;So You Think You Can Dance judge explained how she and Kylie have changed things in order to make it work this time around. “We’re still learning things, setting new boundaries, releasing boundaries…all the normal things,” JoJo revealed. JoJo and Kylie have been spotted together quite a bit since reconciling, including at a celebration for Pride Month in June.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mooahlo57EonnKsqOinV2lv6bDjG1ucnFkaoRw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
