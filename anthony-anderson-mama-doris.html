I was like, 'I am so sorry! I should’ve known that my mother was going to be a little risque,' and they were like, 'We love that, and we want to talk to you about bringing your mother onto 'To Tell the Truth' with you.'"</p><p style=text-align:start>He added: "They’re like, 'Do you have a problem with that?' I was like, 'No, not at all. That’s one less check I’ll have to write every month.'"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mama Doris became co-host (and hilarious commentator) on 'To Tell the Truth' alongside Anthony Anderson when the show rebooted in 2016.</h2><p>To Tell the Truth consists of a celebrity panel who are presented with three contestants who are acting the part of the same person — but only one of them isn't acting. The panelist must figure out who that is and who are impostors. And every wrong answer by a panelist is money earned.</p><p>The show goes all the way back to 1956. And in 2016, after Anthony became the host with Mama Doris as his sidekick, they went on to make their mark on the series and are part of the reasons why viewers keep coming back to watch it. They're literally the dynamic duo of the show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by DORIS DAY BOWMAN (@theofficialmamadoris)</a></p></figure><p>In fact, when Mama Doris missed a couple of episodes in early 2021, fans took to social media to demand answers, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one viewer saying</a> "it's only half the show without Mama."</p><p>Thankfully, Mama returned soon after, telling fans on social media, "I'm back this week on the Queen's Throne and the laughs won't stop!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We miss you on TTTT, Mama Doris!
