He was once in the army, but moved to New York City as a youngster to pursue modeling; living with actor Channing Tatum in the process. He then moved to Miami and eventually Los Angeles, where he decided to change his name from Jason to Jax because there were already too many Jasons in the industry. He’s booked gigs with the likes of&nbsp;Taco Bell, Trump Magazine, GQ, Abercrombie & Fitch and JC Penny, and he was also the cover model for the popular video game Assassin’s Creed. He rose to fame in 2013, when The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills spinoff Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;featured Jax as SUR Restaurant’s sexy, often shirtless bartender. Jax became a breakout star on the show due to his womanizing ways and his on-and-off relationship with his co-star Stassi Schroeder.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Jax Taylor&nbsp;is best known for starring in the reality show Vanderpump Rules, where he steals scenes as the show’s undeniable villain.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Jax Taylor&nbsp;lost his virginity at the age of 19, and has since become a self-diagnosed sex addict. He dated and lived with Stassi Schroeder for a couple of years, but their relationship ended when he cheated with a hostess in Las Vegas. He tried to win Stassi back by getting her name tattooed on his arm, but his efforts backfired when it was revealed that Jax had once — sorry, twice — slept with Stassi’s friend Kristen Doute. As of February 2014, he is dating 23-year-old model&nbsp;Carmen Dickman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3yrrddmq5qxnKS%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
