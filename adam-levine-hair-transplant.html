Here's what we know.</h2><p>Our beloved Adam has sported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of unique hairstyles </a>within the last two years alone. According to BuzzFeed, prior to the big buzz, he's donned short 'dos, mohawks, bleach blonde beach-y locks, and even braids. Each of these looks worked relatively well for him, so fans were suspicious that he decided to go completely bald... had he been heading toward baldness naturally, and using hair transplants all along?</p><p>Rumors alleging that Adam has gotten hair transplant surgery have been circulating the world wide web for years now. According to Hair Transplant Dubai, he had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">visible signs of hair loss</a>, but suddenly fixed it about six years ago. Fame Watcher also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speculated on the matter</a>, pointing out his change in appearance:&nbsp;</p><p>"Levine looked like he was once losing a battle with male pattern baldness, but his hair looks fuller in recent years, and his hairline looks like it may have shifted forward a bit.

Until Adam confirms the rumor himself, we'll never know if he has been getting hair transplants, and now has decided to remove them, but we have our suspicions.

The video shows Adam smoking a joint and drinking a glass of red wine in a yard by himself.</p><p>The chorus sings, "Youâ€™re the only hand in my back pocket / If you ever left I go psychotic / Heaven hear me crying, crying oh, oh / Baby you're the key to my heart locket." The end of the video features a message from the <a href=# title="(opens new window)" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), calling for an end to the war on drugs, specifically weed.&nbsp;</p><p>""It's time to end the War on Marijuana," the message reads.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"The aggressive enforcement of marijuana possession laws needlessly ensnares hundreds of thousands of people into the criminal justice system and wastes billions of taxpayers' dollars What's more, it is carried out with staggering racial bias. Despite being a priority for police departments nationwide, the War on Marijuana has failed to reduce marijuana use and availability and diverted resources that could be better invested in our communities."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Adam's new look may be attributed to hair loss, but it could also simply be his way of cooling off for summertime.
