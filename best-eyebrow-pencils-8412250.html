From bold brows like those worn by Cara Develingne and Lily Collins to trendy bleached brows rocked by Amelia Hamlin and the Hadid sisters, eyebrows are a statement piece for the face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested 38 eyebrow pencils from the most popular makeup brands to compare the texture, usability, pigment, and performance of each. After fluffing, tinting, and prepping our brows using these beauty products, we created a list of the seven best eyebrow pencils for beautiful arches.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For added measure, PEOPLE sat down with celebrity eyebrow specialist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Joey Healy</a> to gain insights about the best techniques for using eyebrow pencils. “There are three looks that pencils are really good for,” Healy tells us. “One is a slick architectural look, …another [is] that faux feathery look, and you can even do that ombré kind of brow where it gets darker as you get further up to the tail.” He explains that you can use eyebrow pencils to create each look using different angles, strokes, and blending techniques.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re going glam for a night out or keeping things natural for a quick Target run, these were considered the best eyebrow pencils that PEOPLE Tested.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-charlotte-tilbury-brow-cheat-refillable-hair-like-eyebrow-pencil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charlotte Tilbury Refillable Eyebrow Pencil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charlotte Tilbury Brow Cheat Refillable Hair-Like Eyebrow Pencil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tXBRUYGs_hDLbDbknum5J8Dl58M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/charlotte-tilbury-brow-cheat-refillable-hair-like-eyebrow-pencil-534ed654638248f798d952dd9f67b741.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Pigment</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Shade Range</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>The eyebrow pencil features a rich pigment that makes filling in brows a total breeze.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The double-sided tip and spoolie combination make it easier to get a precise application.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s easy to maneuver around your brows for a more customized look.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The body of the pencil was comfortable to grip and maneuvered easily along the brow bone, and the angled tip created precision with each stroke. “Pencils can be great because you can really define the brow,” says Healy. “You can heighten an arch, you can extend a tail, and you can create a really tight definition.” The pencil also felt quite sturdy — it didn’t drag at all or seem like it would break with extended use. The color is pigmented, but not enough to make it obvious that your brows are filled in. You only have to apply each stroke once for a natural look, filling in gaps between hairs. But, you can also layer it to create a fully structured brow for glam makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This pencil gives a matte finish, so it doesn’t distract from the rest of your makeup. And if your brows are curly, it also has a spoolie on the end to brush them into place before applying the tint.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only drawback is there are only eight shades available — from light blonde to natural black — and it would be more inclusive to have lighter shades available as well as gray and red tones. The price is consistent with other brow pencils, and considering the quality of this option (near-perfect score in testing!), it’s an ideal eyebrow pencil to add to your makeup routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>8 | <strong>Pigment:</strong> Rich | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte | <strong>Uses:</strong> Shaping, filling | <strong>Best for:</strong> Thick or thin brows, structured brows | <strong>Refillable:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-runner-up-anastasia-beverly-hills-brow-definer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall, Runner-Up</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Definer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ABH Brow Definer " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tneniRfllRJH-pm4Di6nYYTNoto=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/abh-brow-definer--c10ddbd781924f1380bbb3f7616104b1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Pigment</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Shade Range</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>It has a rich and creamy formula that fills in sparse brows.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The angled, self-sharpening applicator makes it easy to outline eyebrows.&nbsp;</p></li><li readability=0><p>It comes in 12 different shades, including options for gray and red hair.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Narrowing down the best eyebrow pencils was a challenge and, in addition to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Charlotte Tilbury Brow Cheat Refillable Hair-Like Eyebrow Pencil</a>, our testers also loved the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Definer Triangular Brow Pencil, which they dubbed the “gold standard for brow pens.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This rich and creamy eyebrow pencil comes highly pigmented in 12 different shades, including a couple of options for red hair as well as a taupe hue for gray hair. It’s designed specifically for outlining and filling in thin, sparse eyebrows, but its included spoolie brush makes it possible to build and blend color for any eyebrow type.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While testing this formula, our team was most impressed by its creamy formula which they recommend for applying soft, delicate strokes that don’t feel too heavy-handed on top of natural hairs. They also recommended it as one of the best eyebrow pencils for mature faces as it has long-lasting pigment that stays put over gray patches.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The shade range is the most impressive on our list. However, our testers found that this line didn’t quite hit the mark when it comes to a soft black formula as there isn’t anything in between the Ebony and Granite tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>12 | <strong>Pigment:</strong> Rich | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte | <strong>Uses:</strong> Outlining, filling | <strong>Best for:</strong> Thin brows | <strong>Refillable:</strong> No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-elf-instant-lift-brow-pencil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>e.l.f.

Our tester has thicker eyebrows and appreciated the heavier texture which applied smooth color between each hair. “It’s the right amount of pigment, not overly heavy, but saturated enough to actually fill in my brows,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The saturated pigment of this pencil makes it a great tool for the ombré style brow. Healy says you can create an ombré look “by blending more in the front and less on the end,” — creating a light-to-dark look from the center of your eyebrow to the tail.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester had no trouble gripping the pencil and maneuvering it across her brow. Once her brows were thoroughly filled, our tester praised this pencil for not leaving any gaps. “The color I used was deep brown, and a little dark for me, but it still looked natural,” she observed. Though the small shade range (five colors!) makes it difficult to get a perfect shade match, it’s not a deal breaker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I would definitely recommend this one, especially considering the price,” said our tester. It earned a high score in all of our tests, and we think this is a solid eyebrow pencil for someone with a lower budget. And it’ll save you from creasing your brows because you won’t be frowning at the price!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>5 | <strong>Pigment:</strong> Medium | <strong>Finish: </strong>Natural | <strong>Uses:</strong> Filling in gaps, creating definition | <strong>Best for:</strong> Thick brows, ombré brows | <strong>Refillable:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-gucci-crayon-dfinition-sourcils-powder-eyebrow-pencil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Splurge</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gucci Crayon Définition Sourcils Powder Eyebrow Pencil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gucci Long Wearing Eyebrow Pencil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/n1la2byo6I3SWQQJMdlaAW9puB4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gucci-long-wearing-eyebrow-pencil-dd08f53d86d14c59b96e26c786768957.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Pigment</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Shade Range</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>The luxury eyebrow pencil comes with a spoolie and a sharpener.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has an ultra-rich pigment with a creamy finish for filling in and lining your brows.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite its heavy pigment, the formula feels lightweight on the skin.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may not be an Italian heiress, but that doesn’t mean you can’t channel Lady Gaga’s eyebrows from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>House of Gucci</a>. This Gucci powder eyebrow pencil creates an Oscar-worthy brow perfect for a full glam look. Its creamy texture glides across the brow, and feels lightweight on the skin. The pigment is dark, and perfect for outlining and filling in gaps in the brows.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester felt that the traditional pencil end was too wide to create natural-looking hair strokes because she has thinner brows, but the sharpener (included!) can help create a finer point. “It [wouldn’t] be my go-to if I’m looking for a natural look, but definitely something I would pick for glam,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This pencil tint locked in place, and even when our tester rubbed her brows repeatedly, “there was absolutely no smudging,” she said.

Something that our brow architects deal with is the type of wax called carnauba wax.” He praises the wax for being an emulsifying agent, emollient thickener, and hypoallergenic — which basically means it's high quality and performs well. Another thing to watch for is claims of being “waterproof.” Healy explains that “water-resistant” is sufficient because “waterproof” can mean materials that make the color hard to remove, causing damage to your brow hairs.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Color Matching</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When selecting a tint for your eyebrows, the general rule is to go either slightly lighter than your natural hair color, or match the exact shade. (But it’s your face, so if you want dark brown brows and light blonde hair, that’s okay too!) Most makeup brands have between five and 10 shades to choose from (like classic blondes, browns, and blacks) so you may need to try more than one shade — or even layer two — to get an exact match.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Brow Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though a good eyebrow pencil can change the shape and fullness of your brows, you should still keep your brow type in mind when selecting the right pencil. Some are designed with thin angled tips to add volume with hairlike strokes in sparse brows, and others have a thicker tip to fill in gaps and create more of a shaded-in brow.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Applicator</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some applicators come with a spoolie on the end to brush and shape the hair before applying color to your brows. “Don’t ignore the spoolie side because it does help you control the color,” says Healy. “Sometimes I think of the two sides as ‘addition’ and ‘subtraction.’ Addition with the pencil lead, and subtraction with the spoolie, which helps you soften and blend.” Others have traditional pencil tips (need sharpening) vs. cream-based refillable tips that glide along the brow. The refillable tips are usually narrow and better for shaping and creating precise lines, and the thicker pencil tips are better suited for filling in gaps and creating dimension.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Uses</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can do a lot with your brows if you just set your mind and your pencil to it. Whether you want your brows tight and arched or loose and feathery, the right pencil can help you achieve your desired look. Pro tip? “Less is more,” says Healy, adding that you only need a little color and blending out the pencil will help it last longer.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-eyebrow-pencils></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Eyebrow Pencils</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During a day of glam in our Manhattan lab, 10 beauty testers got to work on our brows with 38 of the best eyebrow pencils on the market.

Was the pencil gritty? Creamy? Fragile? Sturdy? Did it smudge when we rubbed it with our fingers? Each was scored accordingly.</li><li><strong>Ease of Application:</strong> We then applied the pencils to our brows, mimicking hairlike strokes, filling in the arch and tail, and addressing any remaining gaps. For the pencils that came with spoolies, we used the brushes to help smooth out the hair and spread the color. Then we considered how easy it was to apply, and of course, how it looked. Some pigments were too dark, others too light, and some… just right.</li><li><strong>Shade Range: </strong>The last consideration was the shade range, and, in some cases, the lack thereof. Was it easy to find a shade match? Is there a large enough variety? Our top picks ranked well in each of these categories, earning their spot on our list (and in our makeup drawers!).</li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-9386801a-1188-4491-a251-04e6e1f93029></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50.424242424242><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long do eyebrow pencils last?</span></p><p>Eyebrow pencils can last up to one year.
