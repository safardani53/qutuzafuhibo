Case in point: Amy Acker and her future husband, James Carpinello,</p><p>James revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadway Buzz</a> that he and Amy had mutual friends that suspected that they'd make a good match. He decided to attend a party Amy was throwing sometime in 2002, and the couple have been inseparable ever since. They dated for a year before tying the knot in 2003. (See? True love isn't dead!)</p><p>So what was it about Amy that made James, a Broadway/TV/film actor in his own right (here's his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> profile for a look at his acting career thus far), realize that the actor was the love of his life?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>James said in the same Broadway Buzz interview: "There was something about her — she comes from Dallas and is so sweet and level and genuine and centered — that was everything I hoped that girl would be for me. You know how you have an idea in your head of what you hope it will be like when you’re in love, but you never seem to quite find that girl? Well I met her."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The actor joked that he nearly screwed up his relationship with Amy before it even began when an old flame called him up right around the time he started to fall for his future wife.</p><p>Thankfully, all's well that ends well! James ended up popping the question to Amy on an Australian beach when he was filming The Great Raid.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do Amy and James have any kids?</h2><p>Amy, who was best known for her roles as Winifred Burkle and Illyria on the television series Angel before her role on The Watchful Eye, does in fact have two kids with her actor husband James.</p><p>The couple have one daughter, Ava Grace Carpinello, and a son, Jackson James Carpinello.
