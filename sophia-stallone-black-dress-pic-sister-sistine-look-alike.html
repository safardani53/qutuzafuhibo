She’s perfectly made up with rosy cheeks, red lipstick and flawless makeup around her brown eyes. She has her hair in loose honey blonde curls in a pic she captioned “<span title=Edited>I look like I’m waiting for Dracula.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>With her high cheekbones, perfect nose and stunning eyes, Sophia looks like she could be 21-year-old sister <strong>Sistine</strong>‘s twin. The girls are close in age with Sistine celebrating her birthday on June 27 and their features are nearly identical. Thankfully Sistine just dyed her hair a much lighter blonde color recently to it’s finally easier to tell them apart. Sistine had the same honey colored locks that Sophia has when she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>accompanied her dad</a> to the Cannes Film Festival in May and in some pics it was hard to tell which daughter was on his arm.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Both girls definitely got their looks from their former model mom <strong>Jennifer Flavin</strong>, 50, as their resemblance to their mother is uncanny. They look nothing like their 72-year-old tough guy action hero dad. While Sistine seems to be breaking into acting and is a social media influencer&nbsp;with over a million followers, Sophia just graduated from the University of Southern California on May 10 from the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism. Though the beauty like her sibling boasts over a million IG followers as well.</p>Sly was so happy attending her ceremony, posting an <a href=# rel=nofollow>IG photo</a> of his eldest daughter in her cap and gown and holding her degree in the air. He captioned it: “O<span title=Edited>ur daughter SOPHIA graduates from USC !!!! An absolutely amazing day for us all. So proud!!! @sophiastallone.”</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH14e49rZqynoJ22onnSrZilpJ%2Bjsm6uy5qapGWUp7K0v4ypoJxlo57AtbHRZqqiq6Seu6Z5y6impGWRobassY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
