This week he released his first cookbook, <a href=#>Yellowstone: The Official Dutton Ranch Family Cookbook</a>, which features 55 original <a href=#>recipes inspired by the Paramount Network series</a>.</p><p>“I was able to put a lot of my staple dishes in here,” Guilbeau exclusively told Us Weekly ahead of the book’s debut. One such dish is his blueberry cobbler, which he says is a go-to because it’s much easier to make than most desserts.</p><p>“I was never a great baker because there was so much measuring and science and math involved,” he joked. “So, I started working with making cobblers because it’s something you can make on such a large scale, and you can make it pretty quickly with minimal measuring.”</p><p>The cobbler, he promised, isn’t too complicated to try at home. “It’s important to remember to keep things real simple sometimes,” he explained. “Just a few simple ingredients can really, really shine very well if you give it the time.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for Guilbeau’s blueberry cobbler recipe:</p><h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Yellowstone-Chef-Gator-Guilbeau-Shares-His-Recipe-for-Beth-and-Rips-Sweet-Blueberry-Cobbler-01.jpg></h3><h3>Beth and Rip’s Sweet Blueberry Cobbler</h3><p>Serves 6</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><p>1 cup all-purpose flour<br>2 teaspoon baking powder<br>⅓ cup granulated sugar plus 2 tablespoons, plus granulated sugar for sprinkling<br>¼ cup firmly packed light brown sugar<br>¼ teaspoon fine sea salt<br>Pinch of ground cinnamon<br>Pinch of ground nutmeg<br>1 cup whole milk<br>1 large egg, beaten<br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>1 pound fresh blueberries<br>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest<br>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br>½ cup unsalted butter<br>Vanilla ice cream, for serving</p><p><strong>Instructions</strong></p><p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</p><p>2. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, ⅓ cup of the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg to combine. In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg and vanilla until blended.</p><p>3. In a third bowl, toss together the blueberries, lemon zest, lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar.</p><p>4. Place the butter in a 10-inch cast-iron pan and place the pan in the oven. When the butter is melted, whisk together the flour mixture and the milk mixture until just combined; there will be a few lumps remaining, which is OK. Pour the batter evenly over the melted butter, and then spoon the blueberry mixture evenly over the batter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>5.
