He rose to fame in 2015 with his hit “Trap Queen” and his self-titled debut album that year scored two more hits with “679” and “My Way.” While the rapper, whose real name is&nbsp;<strong>Willie Junior Maxwell III,&nbsp;</strong>has had a successful career in music, he’s also been the subject of controversy due to criminal activity. The rapper was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sentenced to six years</a> in prison after he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>plead guilty</a> to drug trafficking charges on May 24, 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While he’s made headlines with his music and controversy, Fetty has mostly kept his personal life private. While he’s been involved with many different women over the years (and fathered six children with five different women), he’s only been married one time to&nbsp;<strong>Leandra K.

It was revealed that the pair tied the knot in August 2019, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>iHeartRadio</a>. Leandra revealed that she and Fetty got married in since-deleted Instagram posts and changed her bio to read “Mrs. Maxwell,” after their ceremony. She confirmed that they were wed in a post, where she referred to the “Trap Queen” rapper as her “husband” and in another she shared a photo of some roses that he gave her and captioned it “wife life.”</p><h2>Fetty proposed with a $37k diamond ring</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Shortly after the pair reportedly got married, the jeweler Eliantte & Co. shared an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> video showing the beautiful engagement ring that Fetty used to propose. Along with a video showing the giant rock, they wrote, “Congratulations Fetty and Leandra” in the caption. After the pair split, Leandra filed documents demanding that Fetty give her back the ring or repay her the estimated value of $37,000, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Leandra accused Fetty of being abusive and cheating</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fetty-wap-and-wife-leandra-mega-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The couple’s marriage was very short-lived. Leandra filed legal documents accusing the rapper of being abusive in May 2020, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.&nbsp;She claimed that a month into their marriage, they got into an argument and Fetty punched her, bruising her and giving her a black eye.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Besides the physical abuse, she also claimed that he struggled with substance abuse with both alcohol and drugs. She also claimed that he had affairs with different women, including traveling with a mistress, during their marriage, which led her to file for divorce. The pair’s divorce was finalized in September 2020, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fetty and Leandra shared no children</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>While Fetty is a dad to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>six children</a> with five baby mamas, Leandra and him didn’t have any kids during their short marriage. Fetty has kids ages 5 to 12. Sadly, his youngest daughter <strong>Lauren&nbsp;</strong>died from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>congenital cardiac anomalies</a> when she was four years old in August 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Weq62xXayusXnWop2eZWVmfXd%2FkGxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
