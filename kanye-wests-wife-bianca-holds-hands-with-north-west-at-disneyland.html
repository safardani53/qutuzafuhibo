She added a pair of black trousers and what appeared to be Yeezy slides to her ensemble. Bianca, whom <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ye married</a> in 2022, caused a stir online with her revealing outfit at the theme park. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>brunette beauty</a> turned heads in an all-white <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bodysuit</a> with a figure-hugging design.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The daring ensemble was sleeveless with a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>plunging neckline</a>. Bianca wore her tresses slicked back and parted them slightly off-center. She completed the look with bright-yellow high heel boots and wore no jewelry. After <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of her look landed on social media, many Ye fans took to the comments to react. “I Like Her Outfit,” one admirer <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>, while another wondered, “What’s she wearing?” A separate fan <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a>, “Bianca has a very interesting perception of fashion.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ye Kanye West , North West and Bianca today in Disneyland Park , Ca <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/FrMEpJX6wu</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>— YEFANATICS (@yefanatics) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 14, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>North’s recent outing with her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dad and Bianca</a> comes just a few days after she performed alongside Kanye on December 12. His mini-me revealed her rapper name during the Vultures listening party and was cheered on by many of the Yeezy designer’s fans (watch the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video here</a>). “I love it here / We’re gonna take over another year / It’s your bestie Miss, Miss Westie,” North rapped on the track. “Don’t try to test me / It’s gonna get messy / Just, just bless me, bless me / It’s your bestie Miss, Miss Westie.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Meanwhile, North’s momma took to Instagram on December 14 to share a sexy new <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mirror selfie</a> in nothing but a bikini. Kim joked in the caption that she would <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“date” herself</a> by writing “IDD8ME.” Many of her 364 million followers flooded the comments with reactions and compliments for the SKIMS co-founder. “She’s reminding ya that she still got it bc [sic] ya stay hating,” one fan penned as they defended Kim from the haters, while another chimed in with, “STUNNING.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5BuZqSZnq6ybsPErKusZaees6Z5waKYp5uRYrWwuMOsZKGZnpnAbsPIrZ9mpp%2Bnwal51p6qrWWRqXqltdKnnLKkkaOxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
