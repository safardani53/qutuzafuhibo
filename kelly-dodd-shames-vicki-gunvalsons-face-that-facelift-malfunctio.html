"You’re better than that."</p><p>"Commenting mean things on an Instagram post?" commented an astonished followers.</p><p>That same commenter admonished Kelly: "Be a better role model for your daughter."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/vicki-gunvalson-at-the-2018-reunion-special.png><p>"Haters gonna hate," another commenter wrote, dismissing Kelly’s word. "People are so damn mean and rude."</p><p>"She’s always been mean," accused another. "It’s sad."</p><p>"It’s really starting to show how much she hates herself and her own life," that same follower claimed.</p><p>"I’ve met some mean women but man she is MEAN," that comment concluded. "Says a lot about who she really is."</p><p>"Ya’ll look great…ready for next season," praised a more positive comment.</p><p>That comment continued: "Hopefully Kelly finds something else to do…don’t want to be mean but she doesn’t have good manners…"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/kelly-dodd-and-vicki-gunvalson-683x1024.jpg><p>Other commenters, however, shared Kelly Dodd’s alleged bad manners.</p><p>One wrote that Vicki Gunvalson’s face, now free of fillers, looked "like an avocado."</p><p>Everybody loves avocado but nobody wants to be compared to one, you know?</p><p>"I find it fascinating that the people sticking up for Vicki are being rude and hateful towards Kelly," points out one comment. "How is it any different?"</p><p>"If you are cutting down and bashing someone who’s being rude," the comment continues. "You’re doing the exact same thing."</p><p>The debatable comment concludes: "but think it’s okay because you’re standing up for someone else."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/vicki-gunvalson-goes-under-the-knife-1024x558.png><p>Back in July, Vicki Gunvalson opened up very frankly about plastic surgery while speaking to Us Weekly.</p><p>"I had a lot of fillers in my face," Vicki admitted. "And I didn’t feel like it was me anymore."</p><p>"I had too many doctors, too many different times say, ‘Let’s do this, let’s do that, let’s fill here, let’s do Voluma, let’s do Sculptra,’" she said.</p><p>"And by the time I was done," Vicki noted. "I looked in the mirror and was like, ‘I don’t even look like myself.’"</p><p>Notably, one of the earliest episodes of The Real Housewives of Orange County featured Vicki, center stage, at a botox party.</p><p>That said, people are absolutely entitled to change their minds and do whatever they like to their flesh prisons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/kelly-dodd-and-vicki-gunvalson-scaled.jpg><p>Vicki also revealed that it was with some shady-sounding encouragement from Tamra that she decided to go under the knife.</p><p>"Tamra kept telling me, ‘You need to do another face-lift, your neck is getting old!’” she shared.</p><p>Who talks like that to their "friend?"</p><p>“And I’m like, ‘Wonderful.’ Tamra looks so good. She got hers done about a year ago," Vicki continued.</p><p>She said: "I kept asking Tamra and she goes, ‘Yes! You need it, you need it!’"</p><p>"Now my skin looks baby smooth,” she shared. “I don’t have a wrinkle, I don’t have a divot and I have no fillers. I look like was 40 or 35."</p><p>So maybe the photo that Tamra shared was simply bad lighting — not that she looked bad in it.</p><a href=#><img width=1707 height=2560 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/kelly-dodd-and-vicki-gunvalson-scaled.jpg alt="Kelly Dodd and Vicki Gunvalson" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Kelly Dodd: Fire Has-Been Vicki Gunvalson!
