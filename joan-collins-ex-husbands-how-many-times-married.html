I really hated him, but I was so filled with guilt, that he had done this thing to me.”</p><h4>Anthony Newley</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000617807249.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000617807270.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000617805856.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000617807204.jpg><p>Joan was joined to British singer-songwriter Anthony Newley for eight years from 1963 to 1971.</p><p>In 2017, controversy arose when the pair's son, Sacha Newley, accused his father of pedophilia.</p><p>Joan, 84 at the time, <a href=#>dismissed the allegations</a> as "absolutely untrue," and that she never saw pedophilic behavior from her ex-husband.</p><p>She told Good Morning Britian: "I think that Sacha's being extremely naive and not really knowing the meaning of that word because what Tony admittedly was, is he loved young women and young women of 17, 18, 19 years old. Not children by any means."</p><p>Sacha told The Sunday Times that he thought his father's X-rated 1969 film Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness? is an autobiographical “confession of pedophilia”.</p><p>In the film, the family played as their real life roles, with Joan playing Anthony's wife and <a href=#>Sacha and his sister Tara</a> playing their children.</p><h4>Ron Kass</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/42e4fa32-bfd8-4300-ac23-4f508dbc981a.jpg> <img

after her divorce from Newley, Joan married American businessman and recording magnate Ron Kass.</p><p>Kass was best known as the head of the Apple Corporation, The Beatles' recording producer, and a good friend of the John, Ringo, and Paul.</p><p>Joan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in Daily Mail</a> that Kass proposed to her within weeks of meeting her—even though he was married with three children.</p><p>"For a year, he bombarded me with love, attention and proposals of marriage," Joan wrote.</p><p>The two had one child, Katyana, in 1972, but the marriage went south as Kass' problems with cocaine and heroine came to light in the years afterwards.</p><p>The death blow to the marriage came when Joan discovered that Kass had forged her signature on overdraft document, and the couple divorced in 1983.</p><h4>Peter Holm</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000617807298.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000617807313-1.jpg><p>In 1985, Joan married Swedish pop singer Peter Holm, who was acting as her manager and co-producer at the time.</p><p>Holm, who was 14 years younger than Joan, was carrying out a secret affair with a 20-year-old married woman while Joan was filming Dynasty, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail reports</a>.</p><p>Holm made Joan sign a prenup, and once they had initiated divorce proceedings, he demanded to be given tens of thousands of dollars in monthly allowances, as well two of their jointly-owned houses.</p><p>Joan alleged that Holm should pay over a million dollars for furniture, Christmas decorations, and even food from the fridge that he had taken from their house in LA.</p><p>One of Holm's later girlfriends, Kathy Wardlow, said in 1988 that Holm revealed to her he had only married Joan for her money, and that he had been unfaithful throughout the marriage "because she was old and wrinkled."</p><h4>Percy Gibson</h4><p>Joan is still wedded to her fifth husband, <a href=#>Percy Gibson</a>, who she first married in 2002 in Claridge's Hotel in London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
