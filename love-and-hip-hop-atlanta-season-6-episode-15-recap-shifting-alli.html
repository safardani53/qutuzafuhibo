They were interrupted by Mimi getting a phone call to say Stevie had Eva around Joseline.&nbsp;</p><p>“He knew that I didn’t want that woman around my daughter and he waited until I was in Jamaica to do it,” she barked. The other women could only look in in disgust at his blatant act of desperation.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When Mimi returned home, she wasted no time in visiting her ex-boyfriend to lay down the law.&nbsp;</p><p>“I thought I told you to keep Joseline away from Eva," Mimi began.</p><p>"Then I get a phone call from my baby telling me that she had a great time with her baby sister.”</p><p>"Maybe Vonna took her over there, and Joseline was there for a minute,” Stevie replied.</p><p>Mimi&nbsp;says, “I don’t care if it was for one second. I am now going to have to go take out a protective order to try and keep this woman away from my child because you won’t listen!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>If Stevie was wanting to stop seeing Joseline as much, she had other plans. They met up, and she wasted no time in asking him to join her.&nbsp;</p><p>"I want you to go back to being my manager. I made great music with you,” Joseline says.</p><p>Stevie replies, “I have new talent with them, and I have contracts and obligations.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Tell her that she is done working with you, and you’ll get your wife and your artist back because I know she isn’t as talented as the Puerto Rican Princess,” Joseline&nbsp;fires back.</p><p>Stevie tells her “Before we discuss anything you need to apologize to my daughters. They were really upset by the stuff you put on social media.”</p><p>Shockingly, Joseline agrees to apologize. Maybe she does want to be back in Stevie’s good books.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Rod was furious after a confrontation with Logan about Jasmine. He then returned to Jasmine to find out the truth.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“When was the last time you slept with Logan? he asks.”</p><p>Jasmine says “2013.” Rod says “Not in 2015 at all?”</p><p>Jasmine claimed she did not sleep with him in 2015, so Rod offers up a DNA test for her to prove it. Jasmine fumed, but she decided to do it.&nbsp;</p><p>When Stevie told his daughters about Joseline, they were repulsed. When she showed up, and Joseline apologized, they stormed out.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>They were done with Stevie and with her.&nbsp;</p><p>Yikes.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think it will take for them to make things right with one another?</p><p>Read on!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Love & Hip Hop Cast Rankings: Who Can Actually Sing?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WDcLjOr5xmmZ6Zeqm1z2afqKhdlsGtrc2tmGarlZbAsLqMb2SeqJmovKWxjGpsZqqVmK6xedKhoJ%2BsmaO0bq3LpaBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
