Instead, Piana claimed he used his platform to educate those who were going to use them on how to use the drugs “properly.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“If you have the choice to stay natural or do steroids, stay natural. There’s no reason to do steroids, you’re only hurting your body, you’re hurting yourself,” he explained in an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>April 2016 YouTube video</a>. “If you want to become a professional bodybuilder, guess what – you’re probably going to have to f——’ do ‘em. You’re not going to have a choice.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dave Kotinsky/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Piana first got into the drug at a young age, trying the common cycle know as “test and deca” — a practice that mixes testosterone with the anabolic steroid deca durabolin for bulking — when he was just 18 years old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I went from weighing 185 lbs. to bouncing up over 200 lbs. in eight weeks and competing in a show and taking first and winning the overall,” he said of that initial cycle in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>an April 2014 YouTube video.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That weight gain came with a significant shift in Piana’s strength. When he graduated high school, he said he was bench-pressing 315 lbs. After the steroids, his bench went up to 405 lbs.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Richard Stonehouse/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I actually got pretty dramatic results,” he explained. “That was my first cycle. I have to be honest. The truth is, I was hooked, man. I was hooked. Because my body just grew in front of me. It was growing and my strength was exploding.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was going to be one of the top bodybuilders of the world and I was not going to stop. I was hooked and I knew I was hooked. At this point, I knew this was all that mattered to me. ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The drugs were an expensive undertaking for Piana. When he was competing on the national level, Piana said he would take 20 International Units of Serostim growth hormone a day – which, if bought through the prescription of a doctor, would cost him roughly $8,000 a month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Obviously, I wasn’t going through a doctor and I wasn’t getting it from a prescription,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he admitted in a July 2014 YouTube video</a>. “Serostim is prescribed for HIV and a lot of the guys that are prescribed the growth hormone don’t take the growth hormone because they can sell it for a decent amount of money. Serostim goes between $400-$600 a kit. So I was paying about $2,000 a month for my growth hormone.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As he got older, Piana said he learned that “more doesn’t always equate to better.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When I was younger that’s what I believed, but I’ve learned now how to get better results with taking less and not being as obsessed,” he said. “I would sit down with a pen and paper and spend 8 hours at the dining room table figuring out that cycle. And now there’s no thought whatsoever. I don’t waste more than 5 seconds thinking about it. It’s not that important to me. And I’ve just learned how to get the best results without taking everything under the sun.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He was honest about the side effects — though claimed he mostly didn’t experience them, and knew how to treat them with he did.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve had no side effects,” he said in a March 2014 YouTube video, dismissing common occurrences like acne. “My hair is starting to thin a little bit, but I’m 43 years old. Is that due to steroids? Yes is it because my dad still has a full head of hair. It’s just something you got to take into consideration.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There were occasions where he had his liver checked by doctors and his enzymes were high. To avoid liver toxicity, he would do what he could to bring them down — even staying off the drugs for awhile. “That’s all part of the game,” he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for gynaecomastia (male breast enlargement) — the other common side effect of anabolic steroids consumption — Piana said he had it in the past, but had taken drugs to make it temporarily go away. “I’ve never had surgery,” he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That being said, Piana said he was aware that he was taking serious risks with every cycle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I am total 100 percent aware that damage is being done to my body in the choices I am making. I know for a fact that doing what I’m doing is going to cause damage,” he said. “For every positive I’m getting from these steroids, there’s a negative that’s going to come along with it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“But I have made a choice, and I’m willing to deal with that. I’m willing to roll the dice. And that’s something that you have to be willing to do. But if your choice is to go down that road, don’t sit and think that nothing’s going to happen and that everything’s going to be great. I don’t think that way about anything. Anything’s possible. Whatever happens, when it happens, then I’ll deal with it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m not saying this is the right choice,” he said. “I’m not saying I’m smart. I’m not saying this is what you should do — what anyone should do. I’m just saying what I’m doing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, “That’s my advice to everyone out there. Do your research and learn as much as you can about anything before you do it. There’s always a better way to do something. If you have the choice to do natural or do steroids, stay natural. There’s no reason to do steroids. You’re only hurting your body and hurting yourself. But if you want to become a professional bodybuilder, guess what? You’re probably going to have to f—— do them. You’re not going to have a choice — you’re going to have to do them. That’s the boat I was in. I was competing on stage and I was getting to point where I was going to keep getting blown off the stage if I didn’t do them. So I took that step and that’s the road I chose. And here I am.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m happy with everything I chose and happy with the way everything went in my life,” he said. “And I would have not done anything different. I’m completely happy with the choice I made of deciding to take steroids. My health is fine, everything’s good. It’s been what? 31 years I believe that I’ve been doing this and everything’s great.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Is this a road I think you should take? Absolutely not,” he said. “But in doing this for over 25-years of taking anabolic steroids, obviously I know what the f— I’m doing,” he explained in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>December 2014 YouTube video</a>. “Why do I have a full head of hair? Why do I have no acne scars? Why do I have a flat waist? Cause I know what the f— I’m doing. I’m not abusing this s—.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You need to be aware, educated, and willing to do whatever it takes to remain healthy and keep the body healthy. Remember this is longevity. We want to be doing this in our 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s,” he continued. “I’ll be doing this for the rest of my life. … It’s important for me to live a long life.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added: “Bodybuilding is not my main objective in life. It’s just something I do on the side. So I would never in a million years risk ruining my health or ruining my future do to bodybuilding.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2ipopuYYr2qrc2aZJ2dkam1br%2FTnqmooZRiwrSxjKqsqKyVqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
