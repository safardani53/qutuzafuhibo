The actor spent years to find the right dental solution for the front tooth, perhaps popularly known as the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">“middle tooth.”</a>&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Many fans have noticed that his front&nbsp;right tooth&nbsp;is a bit out of place. In fact, if you have a closer look at his old movies and portraits, the pictures speak for themselves.</p><p>In 2001, just after his breakup with Nicole Kidman, the&nbsp;Mission Impossible&nbsp;star got braces to address an overbite and dental misalignment.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Cruise proudly flaunted his<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;invisible braces&nbsp;</a>with ceramic brackets while walking the red carpet of&nbsp;Minority Report Premiere’ in 2002. The artist’s then publicist Pat Kingsley revealed Cruise would wear an orthodontic device for a year.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even before that, during the&nbsp;shooting of&nbsp;The Outsiders&nbsp;(1983), where he played the role of Steve Randle, the then 21-year-old Cruise removed the cap from one of the front teeth that had been chipped by a flying puck in a hockey match.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>The Dental Imperfection Never Shook His Confidence</h2><p>Despite the dental flaw, the 58-year-old never lacked conviction. During his initial days as a Hollywood hero, Cruise mentioned why he happily embraced his newly found sex symbol status.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In a 1985 interview with Entertainment Tonight, he explained that the tag&nbsp;neither bothered&nbsp;him, nor did he particularly like it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It doesn’t bother me at all. I&nbsp;mean, I don’t, like, resent it. I’m not tortured at night by it. You know, I’m actually very happy that people, you know, think enough of my work to feel that way.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>The Transformation&nbsp;</h2><p>The maverick actor started his career in 1982 with his&nbsp;genetically gifted&nbsp;looks and not-so-perfect smile. According to reports, he initially opted for teeth whitening for his discoloration and alignment procedures.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When he appeared at a&nbsp;public event&nbsp;in 2010 with the completely transformed look, people went head over heels for him. After completing over twenty-five years in the industry, he aced the fresh look.&nbsp;</p><p>By 2012, the actor had undergone a complete&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dental modification.</a>&nbsp;At the 2012 premiere of&nbsp;Rock of Ages, Cruise looked ever so handsome with his newly improved dentition and a fresh haircut. Later in December that year, the actor was also seen at a charity event.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>However, the&nbsp;Mission Impossible&nbsp;star never opened up about his dental transformation. Many dentists believe he must have received porcelain veneers apart from braces.<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;Some </a>dentists also suggested that Cruise might have an implant-supported ceramic crown in the area where he lost his tooth.&nbsp; &nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>At 58, Cruise remains a fan-favorite, and the actor is known for his realistic acting skills, fantastic persona, and charismatic looks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m8rnnCq6yiq5Viwaax06FloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
