Breast milk contains a healthy balance of vitamins, nutrients and hormones that will help your newborn stay healthy.</p><p>However, it comes with its fair share of aches, pains and leakages, which is where the best reusable breast pads come in super handy.</p><p>Disposable, often plastic, breast pads aren't very environmentally friendly compared to long-lasting, budget-friendly reusable breast pads, which can be washed and reused time and time again.</p><p>Reusable pads are typically made of bamboo or cotton, although you'll also find silicone pads, which do more than catch leaks; they also prevent them.</p><p>They tend to be soft and ultra-absorbent, and most come with laundry bags so you can easily throw them in the washing machine without losing any in the process. Some also come in a variety of colours, prints and playful shapes, which may not sound essential, but does make the whole 'leaking bodily fluids' thing easier to cope with, somehow.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><p>*If you click on a link in this article, we may earn affiliate revenue.</p><h2>Best teardrop-shaped reusable breast pads: <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Lansinoh Washable Nursing Pads</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/71L8dagC5mL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><ul><li><strong><strong><strong><strong>Lansinoh Washable Nursing Pads</strong></strong></strong></strong><strong>, 4 for <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>£6.39 from Amazon -<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> buy here</a></span></strong></li></ul><p>Lansinoh is a leading brand when it comes to breastfeeding essentials.</p><p>These washable nursing pads have a unique teardrop shape and are ultra-absorbent, thanks to a super soft core made from plant fibres.</p><p>They're ideal for sensitive skin, too - so no more nasty rashes or irritations for mum.</p><p>Fans like how they are nearly invisible under clothes because of their shape, as well as how soft they are.</p><p>Plus, there's a washbag included to maximise their lifespan.
