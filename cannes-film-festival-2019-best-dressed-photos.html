The 2019 72nd Cannes Film Festival officially kicked off on May 14 and lasts until May 25, and already we have been seeing some gorgeous outfits from our favorite stars. From actresses to singers and models, so many people have been hitting the Palais des Festivals in Cannes, France, showing off stunning looks. Selena Gomez arrived in Cannes on May 13 and from the moment she arrived, she’s already looked chic. She arrived at the Palais des Festivals for ‘The Dead Don’t Die’ premiere, on opening day, May 14, in a drop-dead-gorgeous white satin gown with a bustier top that showed off ample cleavage, and a plunging slit on the side of the dress. Aside from Selena, Elle Fanning has been looking fabulous, as she is on the jury of the film festival. The blonde actress looked stunning when she donned a Dior Spring 2019 Haute Couture look from head-to-toe, featuring a completely sheer white long-sleeve blouse with a lace bodice and a black tulle and gold bolero, tucked into a pair of high-waisted black poofy bloomers that were cropped just under her knees. She topped off the unique look with a pair of black and nude mesh Dior pointy toed slingback kitten heels. Earlier that day, Elle was out and about rocking a gorgeous lavender ruffled Ryan Lo dress paired with nude square-toe pumps. There were so many other amazing looks at the festival & you can click through the gallery to see all of the best dressed stars!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLCius2eqmaemaG6brLErKuirpGhenN8kHJkm52jqXqlvsSsqp6cXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
