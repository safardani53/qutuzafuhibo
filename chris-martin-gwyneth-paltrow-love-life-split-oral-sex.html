Just go at him with love and you give him a b*** j**.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Gwyneth was clearly embarrassed as she squirmed in her chair, giggled and turned red, saying to Chelsea, “What if my mom is watching this show?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>It sounds like&nbsp;Gwyneth had everything figured out back then, but did she stop following her own advice when it came to her love life with Chris?

Social research suggests that because we’re living so long, most people will have two or three significant long-term relationships in their lifetime.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>What do YOU think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Did Gwyneth’s marriage with Chris end because of a lack of oral sex?
