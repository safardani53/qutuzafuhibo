He is the son of </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kyle Krug</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Cheryl Krug</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Krug has three brothers, Matt, Adam, and Zack. Like Torey, his three brothers are also professional players. His brother, Matt, played hockey for Robert Morris University and Wayne State University.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Whereas his brother, Adam, played hockey for Adrian College. But Zack has a different taste. He plays volleyball at Siena Heights University in Michigan.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/torey-krug-father-300x169.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is not much information about his parents, what they do, or where they live. But, most of the time, Krug’s parents are spotted during his match.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Torey praises his father, Kyle, as his influencer who convinced him to play ice hockey. He always admires Kyle’s dedication to his gameplay.</span></p><p>Do you want to read about another Ice Hockey player?

Then, for the degree curriculum, he enrolled in the school’s Finance program. But after a short time, Krug switched his interests to Political Science.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While playing in the NHL, he finished his degree in Political Science in 2017. Torey’s fans admired him for his passion for completing the degree.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite the hectic schedule of gameplay, he finished his education by achieving good marks.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Age, Height, Weight, and Tattoos</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Krug is 29 years old. He weighs around 84 kilograms and is perfectly healthy. So, Krug does not need any medical attention, but he regularly performs preventive diagnosis.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Torey is 5 ft 9 inches tall. His height and weight add up extra advantage while playing, which makes him a beast. In addition, Torey’s left hand is much mighty than the right hand as he shoots on the left side.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/torey-krug-fishing-300x242.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Krug has a passion for tattoos. Significantly, he likes tattoos on his hand. However, Torey has recently made a tattoo on his back also.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Torey Krug | Career</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Krug started to play ice hockey from the beginning of his school days. With a keen interest and passion for the game, his father helped him to do training.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After some time,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Detroit Honeybaked</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, a minor ice hockey team, appointed him as their player. Then, in 2003, Krug got the chance to play in Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Later, Krug joined the Belle Tire midget program in Michigan. He was also successful there. After that,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Indiana Ice</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;approached him to play by their side.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Torey played in the United States Hockey League (USHL) and gained 47 points.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Krug holds the record for most points in a season from a defenseman in 2008-09 USHL. Torey has also played in the 13 Clark Cup playoffs and scored seven points for the team.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Michigan State University</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Krug didn’t stop in Indiana Ice. He joined Michigan State University in 2009. Sadly, Krug was the fifth defenseman on the team. But after a year, he performed excellently, people voted him for the Central Collegiate Hockey Association awards.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/krug-in-michigan-300x279.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In a total of 38 games, Torey scored three goals and provided 18 assists. He also helped the team’s all defensemen to score points.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Later, in two seasons, Torey scored 23 goals and provided 39 assists. He was the top-scoring defenseman in CCHA. Also, he is the second defenseman to score in league-winning match history.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Boston Bruins</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After giving a successful performance at Michigan State University’s team, Torey decided to play for the Boston Bruins in 2012. But, at first, he had no salary or signings. That’s why Krug had to play for free.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>With an average of 17 minutes of gameplay, Torey successfully managed to please the Boston Bruins coach. In the 2012-13 season, he became the first-ever player to score goals in two playoff matches.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/krug-playing-300x292.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Krug didn’t stop there. He scored four goals and provided six assists for the players. By seeing his performance, the coach was pleased and decided to assign him as a full-time player.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Additionally, in 2014, Torey scored 14 goals and provided 26 assists. It was his best-ever performance in the NHL. Further, the club signed him in 2016 and offered $4 million per season.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In the 2014-15 season, Krug scored a record-high 40 assists. Since then, it has remained unbeaten in the Bruins. In addition, Torey managed to keep a good relationship with another defenseman </span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brandon Carlo</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, who is now playing in the Bruins.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Krug played for the team until 2020. It was a sad moment while leaving for another club. Boston Bruins decided to pay special tribute to his dedication.</span></p><p>Are you enjoying the article?

He tied knots with his college girlfriend, Melanie Flood, on July 5, 2013. Melanie remembers, “Torey took me to the amusement park in New York on my birthday and proposed to me. There was no chance to neglect him.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The couple is delighted. There are no rumors about their separation or extra-marital affairs.

Seeing her in court, he said, “That was special to me.

Krug keeps him as if he is his child. Also, Torey has an interest in fishing. So, during holidays, he grabs up his backpack and travels to the ocean.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Salary and Net Worth</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2016, the Boston Bruins signed Torey for $21 million. Later, St. Louis Blues, in 2020, signed Torey in a whopping $45.5 million for seven years.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, he easily earns more money than any other defenseman in the NHL. Krug is one of the highest-paid defensemen in the NHL.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/krug-style-290x300.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hence, after calculating his total sum, Torey’s net worth counts $27.6 million.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Also, Torey sells his merchandise named&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>TK47</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.

Through advertisements, he also collects fair money.</span></p><p id=1bYPbH>Krug ranks 5th among defensemen who’ve played 150 5v4 minutes over the last three seasons in primary assists per hour. His mobility and awareness allow him to create dangerous shots and passes, leading to goals.</p><h2 id=FuFyIH>Torey Krug | Even Strength</h2><p id=VfcHGd>At even strength, especially 5v5, Krug uses his skill set quite separately from the human resources.</p><p>Sooner than using his flow and creativity to create high-quality prospects, at 5v5, Krug becomes a transitional, puck-moving defenseman who is a volume shooter.</p><p id=NTeo7I>Krug is a lot more stuck to the point than anyone could anticipate out of a defenseman of his caliber.</p><p>A good approach for this is the portion of the time he redistributes the puck after accepting a pass at the point.</p><p>Of the top seven Bruins defensemen in time on ice this season, they collectively pass the puck after getting a pass at the point 25% of the time.</p><p>Krug is somewhat below average at 22%.
