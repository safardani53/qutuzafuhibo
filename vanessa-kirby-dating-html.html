She shared that she had only met <a href=# rel=follow>Cruise</a> once before the rumors started. However, the most troubling thing was some of their close friends and families believed it.</p><p>I have a boyfriend, and he got a lot of texts from his cousins that were, “Are you OK? Do you need me to come over?” They thought I had run off with Tom Cruise.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Vanessa Kirby's Boyfriend</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The boyfriend in question was fellow thespian Callum Turner.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Kirby and Turner had met in 2014 as co-stars on the set of the post-war British comedy flick&nbsp;Queen And Country&nbsp;and reportedly started dating the following year. However, their relationship was a secret for the next two years, until they had no choice but to go public. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The&nbsp;Mission Impossible&nbsp;actress revealed her relationship with Turner when rumors of her "engagement" with Cruise started. Kirby divulged that she had been dating Callum for two years at that point to quash the 'ludicrous' rumors.</p><p>She told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a> that there was "literally zero truth" in the rumor and that she had been in a relationship for two years.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Months later, she addressed the rumors again in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Marie Claire interview</a>, sharing that she and Turner had a good laugh. The couple continued to date for another two years before they finally <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">called it quits</a> in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>According to an insider, the couple had grown apart because of their busy schedule. They were working on different films, which caused them to spend time away from each other for months on end. However, the source also added that their separation was amicable.&nbsp;</p><h2>Vanessa Kirby's Lesbian Role&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Even though Kirby is not a lesbian, she took on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">role of a lesbian</a> in the 19th-century romance movie&nbsp;The World to Come.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Based on Jim Shepard's eponymous short story, the movie follows the lives of two farmers' wives who find comfort in each other's company after being surrounded by the loneliness brought about by their neglectful husbands.&nbsp;</p><p>They soon fall profoundly and covertly in love even though they have nothing or anyone to guide their newfound love. Kirby, who was fascinated by the 19th-century accounts of working-class, LGBTQ people, wowed viewers with her performance so much that fans started speculating she might be lesbian.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, that is not true.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>For those interested, they can stream the movie on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hulu</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaK6Ro7K0v8BmoqKqkq56pa3ToqWgZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
