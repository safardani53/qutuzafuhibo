Has he found a new gal pal?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Holly appeared on the third season of the Netflix reality series, Too Hot To Handle.</p><p>The show’s whole premise had to do with physical relationships vs emotional bonds.</p><p>As we can see from her photos, Holly certainly lived up to the title.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Of course I cared about the money,” Holly confessed after her time on the reality series.</p><p>She said that she would have regretted it if she and Mngomezulu hadn’t at least tried to make things work.</p><p>“I didn’t come to do the experience for money," Holly clarified, "but I did wanna respect everyone around me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Holly is also a college graduate.</p><p>She earned her Bachelor degree in psychology from the University of Colorado Boulder in July of 2021.</p><p>(Obligatory joke about whether she can finally help Scott get his head on straight)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Like a lot of reality stars, virtually all of Scott’s exes, and frankly almost anyone with her looks, Holly has also done some modeling.</p><p>She might not be an internationally recognized frequenter of catwalks, but she is repped by Donabaldwin, a Denver-based agency.</p><p>Holly certainly has the looks for it — and we can’t help but note that just being seen with Scott could boost her career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Speaking of models who are Scott’s exes … Holly doesn’t just resemble Kylie Jenner.</p><p>Take a look at this photo from her Instagram page.</p><p>Doesn’t she kind of look like Amelia Hamlin? How in the world can she manage to look like Scott’s ex and like his children’s youngest aunt?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Scott Disick has spent years being … kind of a mess.</p><p>Obviously, things were at their worst in 2017, during his worrisome downward spiral.</p><p>At that time, friends were reportedly concerned about him, and not just because he was burying himself ("emotionally") in every 19-year-old model he could find.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When Scott began dating Sofia Richie, despite the weird age gap, things seemed better.</p><p>They were in a genuinely serious relationship that lasted for years.</p><p>Obviously, things did not work out. Scott moved on to another gorgeous 19-year-old with famous parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Things with Amelia didn’t last quite as long as they did with Sofia, but they did provide some reality TV crossover.</p><p>Scott and this relationship came up on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and in numerous interviews with Amelia’s parents, Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin.</p><p>Wisely, they didn’t try to control their adult daughter, instead allowing this to play out — for better or for worse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Scott went full clown in 2021, however, as he bitterly texted Younes — another ex of Kourtney’s — to drag her PDA with Travis Barker.</p><p>It wasn’t just pathetic — it showed how hung up he still is on Kourtney. Amelia dumped him.</p><p>Perhaps Holly will have a different experience, if they’re really dating. Or perhaps not.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2V%2FcMPHqGSiq12dvK242GaqnJmim7yvsYysmqispGKxqr%2FInKJmq6CkwbWxw2auoqyYYri6uMieZKOdnqOys3nLqKZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
