and her fans lapped it up - 22,000 of them. &nbsp;</p><p>Judi says: “Helen’s opted for some red embroidery-topped hold ups for her pose, drawing the eye up to her matching briefs.&nbsp;</p><p>“Her pose looks telling though: hold-ups have a habit of falling down at the worst moments and the way Helen has her legs clamped together there suggests she’s aware of the way that they don’t always defy gravity.</p><p>“Her pose makes her look a little accident-prone, giving the stockings the added appeal of risk and naughtiness.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>ABBEY CLANCY</strong> -
