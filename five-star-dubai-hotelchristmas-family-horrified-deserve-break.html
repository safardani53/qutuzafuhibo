But it’s not very joyous when you’re the woman that has to organise it all.</p><p>As soon as the leaves fall from the trees, I start planning the perfect festive season for the entire family.</p><p>There are more than 20 of us including kids, parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>The preparation is endless from buying the right gifts and catering for fussy relatives to stocking up the fridge.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sick of all the planning</h2><p>When I was a kid, there was no Elf on The Shelf or Christmas Eve Box. And parents weren’t expected to put homemade cookies and a carrot onto a specially-designed plate for Santa and his reindeer.</p><p>But there’s so much pressure to get it exactly right these days.</p><p>The big day itself is no easier with a 5am start to get the turkey in the oven.</p><p>Last year, I did the cooking, clearing up and a mountain of dishes, only to walk into the living room afterwards and find my family members snoozing.</p><p>So in September I booked a solo trip to the UAE with plans to leave my little girl with her dad and grandparents in Northampton on Christmas Day.</p><p>They'll go on visiting various relatives in London, Folkestone, Maidstone and then stay in our holiday home in Cornwall with a couple of other family members - but I don't feel guilty.</p><p>I'm so grateful to be missing the holiday visits, as I dread them each year, it's a really full-on schedule.</p><p>I’m already looking forward to jetting off to a five-star hotel in Dubai today.</p><p>I'm staying for a week and will celebrate Christmas Day admiring the palm trees.</p><p>What could be nicer than spending the week stretched out on a sun lounger with nobody there to bother you?</p><p>While my family peels the potatoes and parsnips for lunch, I will be admiring the palm trees instead of the messy Nordic fir I normally spend the month vacuuming under.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sick of turkey and over-boiled veg</h2><p>I can finally give that dreaded festive meal a miss. Instead of the traditional dead bird and over-boiled vegetables, I’m grabbing a salad from the all-inclusive buffet and acting like the big day isn’t even happening.</p><p>Last year, I gave my parents a luxury hamper for Christmas. I could tell they didn’t like the present long before they slowly returned each item to us, saying they didn’t want it to go to waste.</p><p>Thankfully, I don’t need to worry about gifting this December. Nor enduring hours of forced family fun with tedious games of bingo and Cornish Monopoly.</p><p>I’ve scheduled a trip to the hotel’s spa for Boxing Day, which is when I’m normally enduring a second round of entertaining. There’s a hammam, halo-therapy salt cave and a meditation pavilion.</p><p>But my family aren't over-the-moon.</p><p>As a mum to a five-year-old and an aunt to three under-fives, it’s certainly ruffled a few feathers in my family.</p><p>None of my loved ones share my excitement for my well-deserved luxury holiday.</p><p>People have said I'm selfish... I don't care. Like many mums, I’m truly exhausted from all the unseen mental and physical labour of family life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mums are overworked</h2><p>It’s long past my turn to put my feet up and take a break.</p><p>I feel like I do every single school run and manage to work full-time And it’s me taking charge of everyone’s life admin whether it’s booking swimming lessons, making nativity costumes or baking cupcakes for the church fundraiser.</p><p>Admitting you’re disappearing for the festive season to parents at the school gate is like confessing to a crime.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Apparently, mothers must silently exhaust themselves during December.</p><p>But if all you do is moan about how hard life is, then nothing’s going to change."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/91974ac9-3878-4453-86ea-b3bc8e4a13e1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image00010__1___1_jpeg-JS867118769.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FuZ3FxYGaEcLLIr5xmq6SWv26w1JuYomWYpMGmuMKhqaKrpKKutHnFmqSipKlitbC%2B0aKdop2UYrGmv8SrrZ5lkqeyoreO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
