I love you tons”.</p><p>Michelle, meanwhile, posts on Twitter under the username @MrsMBrewer.&nbsp;</p><p>In her Twitter bio, she describes herself as “The driving force behind #WheelerDealer”, so it appears the pair work as a team, and Michelle has a lot of involvement in the car industry.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What other shows has Mike Brewer presented?</h2><p>Brewer started his television career in 1997, on Channel 4’s Deals on Wheels, and ITV’s Pulling Power.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1999, he presented Driven on <a href=#>Channel 4</a> for one year.&nbsp;</p><p>Then in 2003, Wheeler Dealers started, on the Discovery Channel, which Brewer has presented ever since.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2009, Brewer presented another show on the Discovery Channel — Auto Trader.</p><p>Since 2020, Brewer has also hosted the Wheeler Dealers spin-off show on the Discovery Channel, Wheeler Dealers: Dream Car.&nbsp;</p><p>For the Discovery Channel, Brewer has also presented Deals on Wheels, Wrecks to Riches, and Frontline Battle Machines.</p><p>In 2020, Brewer took a turn co-hosting a show called The World’s Greatest Cars, on <a href=#>Quest</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside television presenting, Brewer launched the Wheeler Dealer <a href=#>Podcast </a>in February 2023, which has so far run for two series.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What cars has Mike Brewer owned?</h2><p>It comes as no surprise that Brewer has a significant collection of <a href=#>classic cars</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Brewer’s first car was a beige <a href=#>Mini</a> 850cc, but he has driven a wide range of cars in the interim period.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, Brewer announced that despite ridiculing <a href=#>electric cars</a>, he’d taken the plunge and bought himself a <a href=#>Porsche</a> Taycan.&nbsp;</p><p>That same year, Brewer decided to auction off a selection of his own cars, many of which he’s restored and maintained himself, at the Silverstone Auctions at NEC Classic Motor Show.</p><p>In the lot were a 1972 <a href=#>Citroen</a> SM 2.7 four-seat coupé, a 1967 Mini Cooper 1275 S, a 1961 Austin Seven Mini 1961, a 1966 <a href=#>Ford</a> Cortina Lotus Mk1, and a 2002 <a href=#>Ferrari</a> 360 Spider F1.</p><p>Despite his love for his collection of cars, Brewer’s schedule didn’t allow him the time to drive and car for all of them.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Brewer has previously said</a> he believes classic cars “are there to be driven. I know that first hand because I’ve got a collection.”</p><p>He said: "Buy something you love, buy something you’re interested in because when you love the car you’re much more likely to be willing to spend time on it, to look after it, to drive it.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Brewer also revealed</a> that his Ford Fiesta Mk1 was stolen in June 2023, a car that had been restored by Brewer and Priestly to mark the 20th anniversary of Wheeler Dealers.</p><p>Despite offering a £5000 reward for the card, as of November 2023, it has not been recovered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgJduam5oaWTEqbHEpZyrZZSarq2x0axkoaejqXqutcqeZJuqlayys3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
