It is unclear when Cantlay first started dating Guidish, but after her appearance at the 2021 Memorial Tournament, she has remained a staple at most of the golfer’s big events.</p><p>Three months later, Cantlay posted a group photo via Instagram <a href=#>that included Guidish by his side</a>. “Thank you to my team and sponsors for all the support in making this an amazing season!” he captioned the September 2021 snap. “Looking forward to what next season has in store!”</p><p>The California native was referring to <a href=#>his multiple wins during the 2021 season</a> and being dubbed the PGA Player of the Year.</p><p>“I set up my system to try and get a little better each and every day. With how I’m practicing, who I surround myself with, and what tournaments I play,” the 2011 PAC 10 Conference Player of the Year said in summer 2021 of his work-life balance <a href=#>via his official website</a>. “I am very specific about my routine and process because I know it’s the best way to set myself up for the big moments.”</p><p>Guidish, meanwhile, acknowledged her partner’s accomplishments <a href=#>following the TOUR Championship</a>. “What a season 🎉,” she wrote via Instagram in September 2021.</p><p>More than one year after going public, Cantlay got down on one knee in September 2022 and asked the University of Central Florida alum to marry him.</p><p>“My whole heart ♥️ 9.3.22 ♥️,” Guidish <a href=#>wrote via Instagram at the time</a>, sharing photos of her engagement ring and the couple’s celebratory dinner. Cantlay <a href=#>confirmed the proposal via an Instagram post</a> that same month — revealing the magical moment had taken place at a winery in California.</p><p>A few weeks prior, the doctor of pharmacy was once again by her man’s side when he won the 2022 BMW Championship in Delaware. “What a week!!!! 🥳,” <a href=#>she captioned an Instagram photo</a> with the University of California, Los Angeles alum and his two trophies.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The newly-engaged pair kept the celebrations going when they<a href=#> jetted off to Hawaii</a> to ring in the new year and kick off 2023 in style.</p><p>Scroll down to relive the sweetest moments from Cantlay and Guidish’s relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvaLA0aKapGWTlru1uMCyZKehm6C2brPUopuiq5ioerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIytoKadnJ67pnnPoaatp6Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
