GOLDFISH SOFT BREAD</h2><p>If you don't remember seeing these crust-free, goldfish-shaped slices of bread, you may remember the slogan of "A familiar smile â€¦ now in the bread aisle."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on discontinued foods">Read more on discontinued foods</h2><p>Everyone's favorite Goldfish crackers were transformed into white and honey whole wheat soft-baked bread, making it a hit with both parents and kids.</p><p>To celebrate Pepperidge Farm's 75th anniversary the company added brown sugar and cinnamon flavors to the lineup, according to <a aria-label="Daily Meal. (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Daily Meal.</a></p><h2>2. CHOCOLATE AND COCONUT MILANOS</h2><p>Another Pepperidge Farm classic is chocolate and coconut-flavored Milano cookies.</p><p>This iteration of the classic cookie added a layer of coconut cream on top of the chocolate layer.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>On <a href=#>Twitter</a>, one user <a href=#>wrote</a>: "Me in Wegmans being told Pepperidge Farm discontinued the chocolate coconut cookies without even a warning," accompanied by a gif of a child repeatedly punching some packages of meat in a grocery store.</p><p>The company reached out to the shopper to let them know the cookies had been officially discontinued.</p><h2>3. KEEBLER PIZZAIR PIZZA CHIPS</h2><p><a href=#>These chips</a> were launched in 1991 and quickly became bestsellers.</p><p>The chips were made of pizza dough and coated in pizza seasonings.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were abruptly pulled from production in 2000.</p><p>Fans are still hoping to get these back on shelves, even going as far as to start petitions and Facebook groups to try and convince Keebler to change its mind.</p><h2>4. GRAHAM CHEX</h2><p>First hitting stores in 1993, <a href=#>Graham Chex was short-lived</a>, lasting only a year in stores.</p><p>The cereal had graham-flavored Chex pieces and mini graham crackers.</p><p>A discontinued foods&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;account (@<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snack_Memories</a>)&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a>&nbsp;a "rare box image" of the Graham Chex cereal, bringing back a slew of memories for many others.</p><p>"I started *making memories* shortly before this was discontinued, and I still remember it," one Twitter user said.</p><p>Another wrote: "I loved this cereal. This needs a remix."</p><p>"Oh man these were so good!" a third wrote.</p><h2>5. BUTTERFINGER BB'S</h2><p>You can't talk about iconic snacks without bringing up <a href=#>Butterfinger BB's.</a></p><p>This treat transformed Butterfinger bars into bite-sized little spheres that were perfect for snacking on the go.</p><p>They were first introduced in 1992 and quickly became popular through an ad campaign with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Simpsons</a>.</p><p>Despite its popularity, the candy vanished from store shelves in 2006.</p><p>To this day people are still asking for a comeback.</p><p>"Still waiting on Butterfinger to bring back Butterfinger BB," one&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>&nbsp;user said in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>&nbsp;last week.</p><p>"Last time I asked they unfollowed me, so might as well ask again."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Coca-Cola has left fans disappointed after announcing a <a href=#>popular soda is gone for good</a>.</p><p>And if you need some hope for the return of your favorite snack, see which previously discontinued flavor <a href=#>Oreo just brought back</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbX94g5JsaWicmaiwsLrToqWunZRiwK%2BtwqSqZqiVpb2mvsidnp5llpa%2Frr%2BMoKalnJaewKl5waucmpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
