But when there was no room at the Inns, he stumbled across the Falcon and wandered in.</p><p>Back then the 6ft 4in bruiser, who is <a href=#>training for a rematch with Dereck Chisora on December 22</a>, was known as “Dillian The Villain”.</p><p>So Falcon landlords Paul and Ellie Higginson were concerned when he first checked in.</p><p>Whyte said: “Back then I was billed as a bad guy, I didn’t care.</p><p>“I am not complaining, because I just wanted to be billed. I knew once I had arrived, I could start changing the image people had of me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000444442963-e1542229299912.jpg><p>“I never had any support or backing, I had just had a few close mates around me who were guiding me and are still around.</p><p>“I never had any ABA titles or Olympic gold medal. I just had a dream and extreme self-belief.”</p><p>The Higginsons were soon won round.</p><p>And now they have adopted not only Whyte but also his two huge dogs into the Leicestershire retreat.</p><p>Playing with canine giants Hades and Zeus, as well as tiny resident Bertie, Whyte said: “The family here, Ellie and Paul, they see me as a son and I joke and call them my white family.</p><p>“The way they support me and help me, with all their staff doing extra things for me, I am so privileged and grateful.<br>“The minute I came in and met the family, it was like we had met in another life, we just clicked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000444443359-e1542229466706.jpg><p>“They have become such a massive part of my life. We’ve never had an argument about anything.</p><p>“I get told off by ‘white mum and dad’. They don’t treat me like a celebrity staying in their hotel, they tell me straight.</p><p>“If Ellie had known I was speaking to you, she’d have had me up early and been telling me to speak nice. I leave one mum in London to come to another one up here!”</p><p>The Falcon Inn pub is a hub for the 2,000-strong local community — and everyone seems to call everybody “duck”.<br>And Whyte should seem like a fish out of water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000444442859-e1542229564918.jpg><p>But a few moments in his company and a scan of his social media accounts reveal why he is so at home, so far away.</p><p>After leg-one of a three-session training day, he said: “After a fight I just want to spend time with my dogs and family.</p><p>“I do not live a lavish lifestyle. You will not see me on any boats or skyscrapers.</p><p>“A lot of guys are insecure about themselves so they show off. I am not insecure, in myself or my lifestyle. My upbringing made me the tough warrior, brother, father and son that I am today.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000444443536-e1542229727470.jpg><p>Being a good son seems to be the biggest motivation in Whyte’s life, above all the belts and money in the business.</p><p>His voice changes when he talks about the little lady who worked so hard to raise him — and who has refused to retire early and share in his wealth.</p><p>She has, however, got her eye on a little pad if he ever decides to fly the South London nest.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Dereck Chisora aiming to snatch Anthony Joshua title shot away from Dillian Whyte in grudge rematch under new manager David Haye</span><p>And Whyte said: “She has told me, ‘Wherever you go I will come, too, but I will need my own two-bedroom place attached to your house’.</p><p>“I say ‘What do you need a two-bed place for, you’re by yourself?’</p><p>“But she tells me she needs another room to put all her things in — and she can have whatever she wants, she will always be allowed to live with me. She is my world.”</p><p>Whyte has a handful of children, the first arriving when he was just 13. He is fiercely protective of them and will not publicly discuss them.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in football</h2></p><p>But he lights up again when talking about his retirement and getting them all around him to enjoy the fruits of his labour, having come from life-threatening poverty. He said: “I don’t know what I will do when I retire, I have lots of little ideas and I have good people around me.</p><p>“I know they are good people because sometimes they tell me my little venture ideas are c**p!</p><p>“I am not with the mother of my kids but I do want some more kids soon and I want to enjoy my life with all of them around me.</p><p>“I want to have all my kids around, I want to watch them grow up and grow old.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZK%2BwxMinnmhvZ2l%2Fc4OQaJuipJyerq951qGwrZ1dl7y5tc2gZJuqma3BsLqMm6adsV2ou6LAwqGcq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
