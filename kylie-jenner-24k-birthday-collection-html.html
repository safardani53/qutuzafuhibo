Kylie Cosmetics was the reason Jenner was once named the world's youngest <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">self-made billionaire by Forbes</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>From skin care to body makeup, <a href=# rel=follow>Jenner</a> does it all. Similarly, her company is also best known for releasing collections that get sold out in hours.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Since she started her brand in November 2015, the makeup mogul&nbsp;has released collections every year on her birthday. These are a mark of achievements for her growth throughout the years.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Every year, she works hard to launch different products on August 10, where she channels her birthday spirit into the&nbsp;creative collection. She works on every aspect of the products, from ingredients to packaging, to give her fans what they deserve.&nbsp;</p><p>And this year is no different. For her 24th birthday, Jenner has come up with a brand new collection — the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">24K Birthday Collection</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>24K Birthday Collection</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On August 2, 2021, Jenner took to her brand's Instagram to post a picture of herself wearing nothing but g-strings and covered in gold body paint. Via the captions, she revealed the name of her 2021 birthday collection.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The next day, she showed off the products via her Instagram stories. Her theme for this year is&nbsp;24-karat, where gold color is the central theme of every product.&nbsp;</p><p>Jenner dubbed this collection her "best collection yet," and it is without a doubt her most luxurious&nbsp;one, as all the products&nbsp;scream royalty. It consists of pressed powders, a liquid liner, three lip products, and a face and body highlighter.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3>Pressed Powder Palette&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>The 24k Birthday Powder Palette contains 24 shades and mostly has shades of gold, nude, and red. In addition, the shadows have all four finishes&nbsp;—&nbsp;mattes, metallics, shimmers, and glitters.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3>Glittery Liquid Liner Duo&nbsp;</h3><p>This is a new product entering the realm of Kylie Cosmetic. The two liners are of copper and pink shades adorned with glitters. They are named&nbsp;Made of Gold&nbsp;and Heart of Gold.</p><p>These are highly pigmented liners that add a pop of color to classic liner looks.&nbsp;</p><h3>All-Over Gloss&nbsp;</h3><p>The All-Over gloss is a beautiful thick golden gloss to add the oomph factor to one's&nbsp;makeup. It can be used on eyes, lips,&nbsp;and face.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3>Lip Serum&nbsp;</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Jenner took&nbsp;this&nbsp;limited-edition product to the next level by infusing it with actual 24 karat golden flakes. In addition, it contains natural oils like almonds, avocado,&nbsp;coconut, grapeseed, and jojoba, among others.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>This Lip Serum will keep your lips soft and healthy with&nbsp;all the natural ingredients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Lip Shine Lacquer Set&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>These are the second brand new products for Kylie Cosmetics in this collection. The lip set has Argan Oil and gives off pigmented shades to adorn the lips.</p><p>Altogether, there are four shades of Lip Shine Lacquer —&nbsp;a brown nude, peachy nude, pale pink beige, and a warm pink nude.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h3>Body Glow</h3><p>All Gold Everything is a gold liquid highlighter that can be applied to both body and face. It provides a sheer golden shine which is reflective but subtle.&nbsp;</p><h3>Face Highlighter</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The Good as Gold is a yellow-gold pressed powder&nbsp;highlighter. It is packaged in a beautiful gold palate with the number 24 stamped on the powder. However, Jenner is getting backlash&nbsp;since it resembles Fenty Beauty’s Trophy Wife.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, she is also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">getting backlash</a> for having an unoriginal idea and tacky packaging. But, looking at the past, regardless of backlashes, Jenner's products have always sold out quickly.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So, there are high chances that this collection will as well. But we will only know&nbsp;after its release on August 10, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOpobamecmepaedomJ%2FdbeMm6CrrJiZrrp5wqijpZ2Tqbawuo2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
