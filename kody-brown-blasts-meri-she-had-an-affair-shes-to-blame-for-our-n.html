We’re just friends," he said on stage.</p><p>This wasn’t always the case, of course.</p><p>Meri and Kody got married in 1994, and seemed relatively happy, even as Janelle and Christine eventually entered the picture as fellow members of their plural marriage.</p><p>In 2014, however, Kody filed to divorce Meri in order to marry new spouse Robyn and legally adopt her kids from a previous relationship in the process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Feeling rejected and dejected, Meri pursued a relationship outside of her spiritual union, eventually meeting a man online.</p><p>Except it turned out that he wasn’t a man. This was a woman pretending to be a man, pulling a scam on Meri in the process known as "catfishing."</p><p>The scandal went public and became very embarrassing for Meri… and clearly ended any chance she and Kody may have had to reconcile in any sort of romantic sense.</p><p>On the aforementioned TLC special,&nbsp;Kodyy described his and Meri’s more than 30 years of being together as having a “hardness” and being “so antagonistic.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>He revealed that after “a lot of counseling” he realized there wasn’t anything left romantically between him and Meri, even telling her as much.</p><p>"There’s just no chance that I ever want that again," Kody has openly said and Meri herself has acknowledged.</p><p>We hope you’re sitting down for this bombshell, which was dropped on air two days ago:</p><p><a href=#>Kody and Meri haven’t had sex in 10 years</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On Sunday, the host of the tell-all insinuated that Kody has “emotionally” left and “abandoned” his sister wives, which made the father of 18 absolutely irate.</p><p>"Abandoned? Please. Take the word back. I take offense to that word of abandonment,” he fired back.</p><p>“Meri had an affair. She was leaving my ass. She made it clear to everybody that she was getting out of there. She was done with us.</p><p>"She can’t admit it now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kody alleged to viewers that the family “circled the wagons” to “protect [Meri] when she realized she’d been dupped," adding:</p><p>"She was deceived. She found something better. She was leaving me for a better, richer man.”</p><p>Brown emphasized that Meri may have been victimized by the catfisher, but only because she went out and did "something wrong."</p><p>For her part, however, the beleaguered Sister Wives star tried to defend herself, stating she was in a "dark place" and never had any intentions of leaving Kody.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>“Did I start talking to this person? Absolutely I did. Did I think I was talking to a friend? Absolutely.</p><p>"It literally was not just, ‘OK, I’m going to meet some dude online and fall in love and want to leave my family,’” Meri said on the topic.</p><p>“A lot of people like to look at that as the defining moment and the fracture in mine and Kody’s relationship and it wasn’t.”</p><p>Despite everything Kody said on the special and all he said throughout Season 16 and the fact that he <a href=#>doesn’t want to touch Meri ever again</a>… this poor woman just can’t let go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I miss emotional intimacy with him. I miss conversations with him. I miss physical intimacy with him,” Meri said on part one of the tell-all.</p><p>“I would love it if he would hold my hand.</p><p>"I have hope that he will [come back to full fellowship] and also if he never does then I’m going to create my own peace and happiness within the family relationships that I do have.</p><p>"This is my family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Tough luck, Kody basically said in response:</p><p>“There’s a point where intimacy is just damage. It’s misleading to have intimacy in a relationship where there’s no real safety. I’m not going there. No, and I never will again. I will be her friend.</p><p>"I will do what I can to protect her.</p><p>"I’m never going to feel safe in an intimate place.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So, in the end, why the heck is Meri still in this quasi marriage?!?!?!?!?!?!?</p><p>“From where I am, it’s been 31 years now that we’ve been married [and] I’m still committed. I’ve made my choice. I’m still here. I do still have hope. I want there to be [a future in full fellowship],” she concluded on the special.</p><p>“I just feel peace when I think about staying in the family because it’s what I want.</p><p>"It’s what I know is right for me.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2V%2FcLfOnbBmmqKkxK95waWYrKyjYrqmvshmqqGdXZ2upXnAp2SanpaWtrN50qGcrGWkpHqjuMCmnGaen6d6sMHRZqVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
