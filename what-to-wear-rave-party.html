A great excuse to go cut some shapes.</p><p>The main style rule you need to know is that comfort is key - you won’t see anyone in high heels. Practicality first, i.e. hands-free bum bags and cushioned wedge trainers.</p><p>To help you choose from the extensive range of athleisure online now, we’ve selected some hot outfits to get you raving in style.<br></p><h2>What should I bring to a rave?</h2><p>You'll need a bum bag full of all the essentials to keep you going all night.</p><p>Bring along a portable phone charger, as you'll definitely use up your battery by taking all of those videos.</p><p>Keeping your phone fully charged is super important, as you don't want to lose your friends.</p><p>A lot of people bring ear plugs, too.</p><p>These will protect your ears but still allow you to vibe to the music.</p><p>Make sure you have cash with you to buy drinks and water, too.</p><p>If heat is a problem, you might want to bring a fan.</p><p>As long as your chewing gym and lip balm are sealed, you can bring them in too.</p><h2>Can you wear jeans to a rave?</h2><p>Jeans don't allow much room to bust some moves, so stick to something that allows you to shake those limbs.</p><p>Raves are non-judgemental zones, though, so if you do choose to wear jeans- don't worry, no one will judge you.</p><p>Remember, it's a rave not fashion week.</p><p>Raves are your opportunity to wear whatever you want, no matter how wacky.</p><h2><b>Neon Vibes</b></h2><p><span>Raves are a place you can go full neon and no one is gonna judge you for it - bring back the acid house 90s with this look.</span></p><p><span>From the clunky Buffalos right down to the fluorescent eyeshadow - if you're looking to turn some heads for all the right reasons then this one's for you.</span></p><p><span>Stretchy bodycons are always a rave-friendly fit - loads of room to dance. Did we mention animal print is so on trend too?</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GL-COMPOSITE-neon.jpg><ul><li><strong>Neon Zebra Mesh Mini Dress, £38 from Topshop - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><li><strong>Hydra FX Lustre Eye Shadow, £9.95 from Beauty Bay -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><li><strong>Berlin Neon Bum Bag, £18 from Topshop - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><li><strong>Buffalo Corrin Sneakers, Neon Yellow, £89.99 from Office - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2><b>Cycling/Crop Combo</b></h2><p>Kim Kardashian’s fave combo is literally made for raving - a crop top and cycling shorts.</p><p>You’ll be able to dance the night away and stay cool in this barely-there bralet, complete with monochrome criss-cross strapping across the stomach.</p><p>Of course, we’ve accessorised with a useful fanny pack and comfy trainers by sports powerhouse Adidas.
