He has been with Leicester since the age of nine.</p><p>Furthermore, Harvey signed his first contract with the club on 25 June 2016 and shortly debuted for the first team as a substitute.</p><p>With quick feet and the ability to score solo goals, Leicester’s No. 7 has lived up to that expectation, scoring over 30 goals and adding silverware for the Club he joined as a kid.</p><p>Together with his boyhood club, Harvey is a one-time FA Cup & Community Shield winner.</p><p>Barnes is a talented product of the Club’s Academy, and his performance has caught the interest at both club and International levels, with a move to Newcastle United F.C. now looking feasible.</p><p>Personal terms between the club and the player have already been agreed upon, with Leicester set to receive around $42-$43.4 million from Newcastle, as reported by Fabrizio Romano two days ago.</p><h2>Naomi Dann: Harvey Barnes’s Girlfriend Or Wife</h2><p>Harvey Barnes and his girlfriend, Naomi Dann, have been in a relationship since 2013.

Similar to Harvey, his girlfriend Naomi was also born in Burnley.</p><p>Unlike her boyfriend, who tirelessly worked to become a professional soccer player, Naomi chose to pursue a degree, and in 2020 she graduated from the university.</p><p>After graduation, Naomi followed her passion and entered the influencing scene.&nbsp;</p><p>By following her dreams and remaining true to her passion, today, she is an <a href=# rel=noopener>influencer by profession.</a></p><p>Similarly, the 25-year-old works as a model and influencer for many brands.

Very limited information is available regarding her family, but we’ve come to know that she has two older sisters, Beth and Emily.</p><p>Their love has carried the weight of the test of time as Harvey has broken into and climbed up the Leicester ranks, including England’s first team call up 3 years ago.</p><h2>A Travel And A Fitness Freak</h2><p>Barnes’s girlfriend is a fitness enthusiast and a travel freak.
