Halyna appeared in Alec‚Äôs film Rust, who also plays the primary character. In a preview of Hoda Kotb‚Äôs Thursday Today show interview, Matthew voiced his rage at the actor for refusing to accept responsibility for the on-set gunshot that killed his wife.</p><p>Baldwin indicated he did not feel sorry about the event in an interview with ABC‚Äôs George Stephanopoulos. Matthew responded in the same way, saying,</p><p>‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt stop myself from becoming enraged as I watched him. I was simply so enraged to watch him openly discuss her murder in such detail and then refuse to take responsibility after having just recounted killing her.‚Äù\</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Halyna-Hutchins-2.jpg alt="Halyna Hutchins" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When asked about the Rust set, Matthew said,</p><p>‚ÄúA lot of industry standards were not followed, and there are several parties to blame.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ludicrous to me that the guy holding the pistol and causing it to fire is not liable.‚Äù</p><p>In an interview with ABC News in December 2021, Alec Baldwin said that someone is to blame for what occurred, and although he cannot reveal who that person is, it is not him.</p><h2>The Rust shooting and Alec Baldwin‚Äôs participation</h2><p>On October 21, 2021, Halyna Hutchins was photographed on the set of the film Rust at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Bonanza City, New Mexico, USA. In addition to Hutchins, director Joel Souza was hurt. The event occurred when a live cartridge was fired from a pistol that Alec Baldwin used as a prop. The weapon had not been thoroughly inspected for safety ahead of time. Halyna was flown to the University of New Mexico Hospital, where she died of her injuries at 42. Meanwhile, Joel was able to recover from his injuries.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Halyna-Hutchins-3.jpg alt="Halyna Hutchins" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Santa Fe County Sheriff‚Äôs Office, First Judicial District Attorney, and Occupational Health and Safety Bureau are investigating. Following the event, the film‚Äôs production was halted. The event has sparked a discussion over workplace safety in the film business, employee treatment, and using actual weapons as props. Matthew, Halyna‚Äôs husband, is enraged that Alec Baldwin failed to accept responsibility for the event. Matthew said the Mission: Impossible Fallout actor killed his wife while filming Rust.</p><p></p><p>Halyna‚Äôs estate also filed a lawsuit, alleging that Alec Baldwin and the other defendants in the case failed to execute industry-standard safety inspections and follow conventional gun safety procedures while filming the movie with actual firearms. After the event, Baldwin also had brunch with Matthew and Andros in Santa Fe, New Mexico. While speaking to the Daily Mail at the time, Matthew said he had spoken with Baldwin and was supportive.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I know someone is not taking responsibility. I can‚Äôt say who that is but I know that it is not the person named Alec Baldwin. Wishing you the very of luck with your lawsuit, Matthew Hutchins. üôèüèø <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#TCMParty</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/D657otmRnN</a></p><p>‚Äî Omar Moore (@thepopcornreel) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 24, 2022</a></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifmqSpo65utNStmqGhnqh6pbXEnWSwoJmhsm6yyKWkoqaXYsGpsYyfoKWlXafCtMCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
