Further details about her condition have not been shared.</p><p class=p1>Two days earlier, Lisa Marie joined her 77-year-old mother at the <a href=#>80th Annual Golden Globes</a> in <a href=#>celebration of <strong>Baz Luhrmann</strong>’s nominated&nbsp;<i>Elvis&nbsp;</i>biopic</a>. Both Priscilla and Lisa Marie even watched in awe as<a href=#><strong> Austin Butler</strong> </a>took home <a href=#>the Best Actor in a Drama Motion Picture trophy</a> for his portrayal of the “Blue Suede Shoes” crooner. In his acceptance speech, the&nbsp;<i>Carrie Diaries&nbsp;</i>alum, 31, even gave Priscilla and Lisa Marie a sweet shout-out.</p><p class=p1>“I also want to thank … the Presley family, thank you guys, thank you<a href=#> for opening your hearts and your memories</a> [and] your home to me,” Butler said on Tuesday, January 10, during the awards show. “Lisa Marie, Priscilla: I love you forever.”</p><p class=p1>The Tennessee native was born in February 1968 to Priscilla and Elvis, <a href=#>who split in 1972</a>. Following her parents’ divorce, Lisa Marie remained close with both her folks until Elvis’ 1977 death at the age of 42.

I can relate to them more, way more. I understand more as I get older. He was quite young [when he passed away]. So I can’t say I knew a whole lot at 42, or that I know a whole lot now. But what I know is that I don’t know everything.”</p><p class=p1>Lisa Marie is a doting mother herself, who shares daughter <a href=#><strong>Riley Keough</strong></a> with ex <strong>Danny Keough</strong> and<a href=#> twin daughters Harper and Finley</a> with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Michael Lockwood</strong></a>. Lisa Marie and Danny, 58, also shared son <a href=#>Benjamin Keough</a>, who <a href=#>died by suicide at the age of 27</a>, in July 2020.</p><p class=p1>“[Lisa Marie] is entirely&nbsp;heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated&nbsp;but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley,” the songwriter’s rep,&nbsp;<strong>Roger Widynowski</strong>, <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;at the time</a>. “She adored that boy.

It’s a Celtic eternity knot,” she wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in July 2022, sharing a throwback snap of the ink. “Symbolizing that we will be connected eternally. We carefully picked it to represent our eternal love and our eternal bond.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloaOWeq6t0aKcZqiimsCtsdhmqa6rmJqxbsDOZp%2Boq6CewaK4jJqdrZ2iYr%2BmvM6rq56cXZius7DImppmmaKnsrTAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
