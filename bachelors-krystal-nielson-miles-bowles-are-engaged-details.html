Free yourself from expectations. The best will come when you least expect it.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The pregnancy news came one year after the lovebirds were set up by Nielson’s trainer, <strong>Kerry Smith</strong>.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“[Kerry] came over and she’s like, ‘I have the perfect guy for you. It’s Katie’s son.’ And I was like, ‘Katie and I are friends! I can’t date her son!’” the Montana native recalled during a November 2020 episode of the “<a href=#>Almost Famous</a>” podcast. “And she just kind of really encouraged it for weeks. Then when we met, I just knew why she was so certain of us being a great match for each other.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The couple, however, kept their relationship quiet until October 2020, when Nielson posted a photo with her new beau on social media.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I am so happy to be moving forward in this new chapter of my life,” the health coach exclusively told Us Weekly two days after her announcement. “We have <a href=#>been keeping our relationship private</a> for several months so that we could really focus on building a solid foundation and getting to know each other outside of what you see in the media.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">She added, “I feel so blessed to have Miles as my partner,” she said. “For our families to be so excited, so supportive [is a blessing] and we just couldn’t be more excited.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Prior to her romance with Bowles, Nielson tied the knot with ex <a href=#><strong>Chris Randone</strong>.</a> The duo got engaged during season 5 of&nbsp;<a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> in 2018 and tied the knot less than a year later.&nbsp;While they exclusively shared with Us in August 2018 that they were trying to conceive their first child, the pair ultimately called it quits in early 2020.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Six months<a href=#> after their split</a>, the Bachelor Nation star confirmed her new romance with Bowles. After announcing her pregnancy in November 2020, Nielson revealed that Randone, 33, had reached out to congratulate her on the big news.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“He texted me and said he thinks I’m going to become a wonderful mother and he’s really, really happy for me and hopes that we can become friends and be there for each other,” Nielson told <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a>&nbsp;in a December 2020 podcast episode. “So we are on really good terms.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270axkpKqpqMGiuIynoJ6ko6S7brnIpZysZZKkxK2x0maYq51dmruorcaem2aclamuqrjSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
