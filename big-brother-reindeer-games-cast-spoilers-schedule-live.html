Change is a must!” he said.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Fans have threatened to boycott in the past, part two</h3><p>A second fan wrote: “All this media coverage and nothing will change. We need to actually tune out and boycott. Maybe if @CBS @CBSBigBrother sees the ratings dropping then they’ll actually do something.”</p><p>“The racist behavior on Big Brother continues. The only way to make CBS take action is for viewers to boycott the show. I refuse to watch or stream that mess,” chimed in a third.</p><p>A fifth said: “Because of all that I have been reading, I have decided to boycott @CBSBigBrother this summer. Unless it is addressed by production, I won’t be watching.”</p><p>Twitter has been flooded with hundreds of similar tweets just like the ones above.</p><p>A casting producer for the show, who chose to remain anonymous told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>&nbsp;that the situation was “really disappointing” and that 50% of the casting team is made up of the BIPOC community.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Fans have threatened to boycott in the past</h3><p>After fans felt Taylor was being treated unfairly on the show, they started a Twitter campaign to try to get every viewer to boycott watching the series.</p><p>One fan even put out a statement and tagged Big Brother and CBS to address the issues that are going on in the house.</p><p>They urged everyone to cancel their subscriptions to the live feeds and to spread the word.</p><p>Other fans on Twitter said they are boycotting the show as well until something is done.</p><p>“And why are you all still watching Big Brother??? Boycott that s**t so it just dies already. And Vote Taylor Americas Favorite Houseguest!!! Nobody else matters,” one fan posted to X.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>More on host Jordan Lloyd, a fan favorite</h3><p>Jordan was one of the 13 houseguests in season 11 of&nbsp;<a href=#>Big Brother</a>.</p><p>Fans quickly grew to love her for her sweet personality, kindness, and her southern accent.</p><p>Viewers fell in love with her, even more, when she got into a showmance with her houseguest, Jeff Schroeder.&nbsp;</p><p>They were one of the first showmances to last outside the house and quickly became a favorite among fans.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality TV star was part of “The Populars” group, but quickly became the last one standing from that group.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaWV%2FcYCTaJmin12Xv7DAx56pZqqVnrulscSrZKCZnZrAbq%2FArKtmq6Cktq2x0axkrJuYmrG2uMRmo6KulWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
