The WWE star, famously known as “The Man,” is pregnant with her and fiancé <strong>Seth Rollins</strong>‘ first child! Becky made the big announcement during her big comeback on the May 11 episode of WWE Raw, after not stepping into the ring since her victory on night one of Wrestlemania 36 (which was taped on March 25). Becky dropped the surprise news while confronting fellow WWE star <strong>Asuka</strong>, who had just learned that her reward for winning the Women’s Money in the Bank Ladder Match on May 10 was Becky’s Raw Women’s Championship title. It was a title that Becky let go of with tears — but Asuka soon learned why The Man was relinquishing the title.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“You go and be a warrior, ’cause I’m gonna go be a mother,” Becky told Asuka after the latter had a solo dance party. The pregnancy was shocking news to Asuka’s ears — it was one surprise after another! Asuka was elated, and the ladies shared a sweet embrace in the ring. Becky broke down in tears again.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Soon after the episode aired, Becky took to Twitter with an emotional message for her longtime fans. “I have no idea what happens from here, but I do know that you’ve made all my dreams come true. I entered the PC in 2013 not knowing anyone, I’ll leave that same building tonight with my new family. Thank you all so much,” she tweeted on Monday night.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"You go and be a warrior, 'cause I'm gonna go be a mother."</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>An incredibly emotional moment between <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@BeckyLynchWWE</a> and the NEW <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#WWERaw</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#WomensChampion</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@WWEAsuka</a>. 😭😭😭 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/IU3BRXDBZD</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 12, 2020</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have no idea what happens from here, but I do know that you’ve made all my dreams come true.

And just a day prior, Becky herself took to Twitter to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a> this: “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Haven’t been injured. Haven’t been talking much lately. So </span><span class=r-18u37iz>#Raw</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> can’t come soon enough.”&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>With a baby now on the way, the past year has certainly been eventful for The Man. She’s thriving in her career, and even broke the record for being the longest-reigning title holder of the Raw Women’s Championship (which she earned at Wrestlemania 35 in April of 2019). Making this victory even sweeter was her engagement to Seth, a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two-time WWE Champion</a>, in Aug. 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Before the pregnancy announcement, Becky <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVELY told</a> <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> how she’s enjoying her quarantine with Seth. “He is my best friend in the whole wide world so we don’t have to set aside date nights because every night is like that but it is all chill and I love cooking and I would cook every night of the week if I can,” Becky told us in an interview published on May 3.&nbsp;“I haven’t been able to do that in years so just doing that and finding a show. Last night we got some books and were reading. I guess it is whatever you can do together but we have also been doing a jigsaw puzzle, so there are fun things like that we end up doing as well!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH12e5BqZpudk6DGbrjYp5qhZaCnsqi6wKerZp2opbKkwMinnmaemafAtXnBmpmyZaOawal50aijpaGeqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
