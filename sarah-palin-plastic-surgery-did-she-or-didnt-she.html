This week, ladies — take a look at her refreshed new face. At age 45, Sarah could easily be mistaken for a very young 35. Could this be due to better rest — no more <strong>John McCain</strong>! — or one or more procedures she’s had done since giving up her governorship?</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>You betcha — so say several skin care docs. Though not extensive, Sarah, like many busy women over 40, may have gone for some less, non-invasive practices.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Sarah might have had Botox around and in-between her eyes, forehead, lower third of her face, and the neck,” says Dr. Neil Sadick, Medical Advisor for Christian Dior Beauty. He also suggests that Sarah could have used a simple laser, such as Fraxel or IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) “to change skin color and make the surface more even.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“She probably had Botox to her crows feet, frown lines, and possibly brows as well, ” agrees Dr. Steven Pearlman, past president of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS). “She went to someone good who is very skilled in Botox. She looks very natural, but without lines, and maintains a bit of movement when she is making expressions, unlike half of Hollywood.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The only area that Sarah still needs to focus on a little bit more is her neck. &nbsp;Says Dr. Pearlman: “She has platysmal banding [horizontal lines in the skin on the neck], something that happens with age, so she should have her neck done too.” &nbsp;This last minor ajustment should totally help Sarah maintain the prior beauty pageant glamour.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Age-wise, it’s also probably good that Sarah has taken a step back from politics. “If she had stayed in politics, it probably would have caused her to prematurely age. The life of being in the spotlight of politics, especially under scrutiny, is very harsh. You saw it with George Bush, and I am starting to see more gray hairs on Barack Obama every day,” says Dr. Jennifer Walden, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>So Sarah, keep the stress minimal, and you won’t need a lift anytime soon!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>-Lindsey DiMattina</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWhpZH5ye5ByZqyZopa1brzApaCnZaChrrTAyJxkrK2inLKzxYydoJ1lo52ybrvRZpuinJ6perS0xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
