This was because he had the title of Champion for 434 days.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, he left the business almost a decade after joining it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>One day he was ruling the industry, and the next day he was gone. This made many fans question, "why did CM Punk leave WWE?"&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the answer to this question.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Did CM Punk Leave WWE?</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Punk joined the company in 2005 and retired from it in January 2014. He explained the reason behind his retirement in&nbsp;Colt Cabana's Podcast, The Art of Wrestling&nbsp;(via <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Bleacher Report</a>). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He said that the tension with the company owner, Vince McMahon, was the primary reason behind his exodus from&nbsp;the company.</p><p>He was also promised a feature in WrestleMania but did not get it.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>CM Punk.

He also accused them of not protecting their wrestlers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after his departure, "they changed everything."&nbsp;The wrestler somewhat believed that they did so just to spite him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Regardless, he was not bothered by it.&nbsp;This was because he understood that while he did not get the benefits from the company, others would.&nbsp;</p><p>Punk also accused McMahon of favoring some wrestlers over&nbsp;others. He also said that McMahon did not appreciate his ideas and creative input.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, Punk gave an idea of sponsorship to McMahon. He was getting many interviews when he was at his peak, and companies were approaching him to sponsor him.&nbsp;</p><p>When Punk relayed this idea, McMahon shot it down. The latter said that it would be unfair to the sponsors of Raw and other wrestlers, and they would get mad.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>CM Punk in WWE Raw.
