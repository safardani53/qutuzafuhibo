Read on to find out more facts about the 37-year-old actor in this exclusive list of 25 things you don’t know about him. And catch Hart in his new concert film,&nbsp;<i>Kevin Hart: What Now?</i>, in theaters now!&nbsp;</p><p>1. My favorite childhood memory was when I was tall enough to get on roller coasters.</p><p>2. My dream costar would be <b>Denzel Washington</b>. If I ever do decide to go into a serious role, you need somebody to help bring that strong validation, and who better than him?</p><p>3. I idolize my mother [Nancy Hart], rest in peace. The best advice my mom gave me was that we don’t do things not to finish them.</p><p>4. In my downtime, I’m a hell of a poker player. I have poker night sometimes, but I work too much to stay true to it.</p><span class=caption></span><p>5. My best quality is my personality. I have the ability to make anybody feel comfortable. The energy that I put out, I get back.</p><p>6. I could watch <i>Tropic Thunder</i> over and over. It’s the funniest movie ever.</p><p>7. A guy got a tattoo of my face on his lower back. That was weird. I was like, “I don’t know what you did that for, sir. I don’t know why it’s there. I don’t really know what I’m supposed to do after seeing that. I guess thank you.”&nbsp;</p><p>8. My favorite book is <i>Of Mice and Men,</i> by John Steinbeck. I read it a long time ago. I like that and a book called <i>Monsters,</i> by Walter Dean Myers.</p><p>9. If I could meet anyone, I would choose Robin Williams. I would simply say, “You were loved. Your stamp on comedy is something that definitely wasn’t overlooked.”</p><p>10. When I first started performing in theaters, I was performing in Washington, D.C. I had on some cool nylon <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a>. I was telling a joke, jumped in the air, landed and ripped my pants in the front. But I didn’t know. So the girl in the front row wrote a note and slid it on stage. It said something like, “Kevin, your whole area is out right now.”</p><p>11. My biggest phobia is reptiles. Dogs are fine; reptiles get up under my skin. Snakes, lizards, things of that nature. I can’t do it.</p><p>12. My worst physical qualities are my two big toenails. They look like burned sunflower seeds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kevin-hart-comedy-90c831e2-9d09-41e3-a5a9-be603a53a6ee.jpg><p>13. My kids [Heaven, 11, and Hendrix, 8] definitely think I tell dad jokes. You don’t realize you tell dad jokes until your kids go, “Dad, stop telling dad jokes.”</p><p>14. My favorite thing about being a dad of my kids is doing things that you didn’t do as a kid with your kids. We have Taco Tuesday Night.</p><p>15. In 2015, 53,000 people came to see me perform at a football stadium in Philadelphia. That was one of the most amazing days of my life. I felt like I had to do that day its service, so I turned the stand-up concert into this movie [<i>Kevin Hart: What Now?</i>].</p><p>16. My biggest regret is not giving the full 110 percent that I should have given in school.</p><p>17. I can play the spoons. I just grab spoons and clink them together.</p><p>18. It’s very hard to have a celebrity crush because my wife [model <b>Eniko Parrish</b>, 32] is so amazing.</p><p>19. The best thing about my wife is her ability to make me better.</p><p>20. I always wish that I had starred in <i>Goodfellas</i>. <b>Joe Pesci</b>’s character, Tommy, is a dream role.</p><p>21. If I weren’t an actor, I’d probably be a hand model.</p><p>22. My favorite sport to watch and play is basketball. My favorite team is the Philadelphia 76ers, but don’t tell anybody I said that.</p><p>23. I love black jeans and a nice T-shirt. I have maybe 30 pairs of black jeans.</p><p>24. My go-to joke is, “If I was taller, would I have a chance?” (I’m 5-foot-5.)</p><p>25. I listen to “Sorry,” by <b>Justin Bieber</b>, on repeat. I am 100 percent a Belieber.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKerpmjeqmt0a1ka21dqbWqusasZLKnpWKxsLrTZqKnp6dirqO71K1kpp1drIF1gJNuZ2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
