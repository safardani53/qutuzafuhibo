It was super challenging.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000354446578.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000354472075.jpg><p>But Emma has admitted Billie made the movie “much easier” to make because she was “generous” with her story.</p><p>She explained: “But [Billie] was so warm and welcoming and open to all of it. She was generous with her story that it made it much easier than if she was like, 'Please don't make this movie about me, good night.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000354601485.jpg><p>The 73-year-old sportswoman is happy with Emma’s portrayal of her, and thinks the ‘La La Land’ star has made her “look so good” in the production.</p><p>Billie said: “Emma, thanks for making me look so good.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000354404300.jpg><p>And fellow director Jonathan Dayton believes the “little distance” has helped Emma to “embrace” her character.</p><p>She said: “We were making a film about one year in [King's] life. It was good to have a little distance, and now we can all really embrace her."</p><p><strong>Got a story?</strong>&nbsp;email&nbsp;<a href=#>digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk</a>&nbsp;or call us direct on 02077824220.</p><p><strong>We pay for videos too</strong>.
